Quoting Uli: 

"This General/NSTableView-like class displays items in a way similar to the Finder's "Icon View". It can use any General/NSCell for displaying items, and the items can be arbitrarily positioned. 

Furthermore, selection of items is handled for you, and items can be rearranged in a number of ways. When embedded in an General/NSScrollView, a distributed view will automatically resize to fit around all its items, and you can snap item positions to a grid. 

This version increases performance, adds basic inter-application drag-and-drop support and a Finder-style General/NSCell subclass."
