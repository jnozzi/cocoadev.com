Does anyone know if there's a tool to spy on the various events a cocoa application might receive?   If anyone here is or used to be a win32 developer, i'm thinking of something along the lines of Spy++.

----

What kind of events? I've never seen Spy++ - is it something like NotificationWatcher?

---- 

Similar to that, i guess.  Spy++ will let you watch all incoming messages to any window you ask it to.   So for instance, if my selected window happens to be a button control, it would show the events for the mouse down, mouse up, singleclick, doubleclick, painting, et al using their standard window message names.   Things that aren't in the list of known api messages are shown as a their numeric value.

----

Maybe FScriptAnywhere is closer to what you want. There used to be something like this for OS<X, but it was never ported over.

----

oohhh wait i just remembered UIElementInspector - [http://www.apple.com/applescript/uiscripting/02.html] It doesn't log events but it's along the same lines.

A really handy mechanism is to set the NSTraceEvents default to "YES" for your application, then run it and watch the console. Example:    defaults write com.deallus.apps.points NSTraceEvents YES The output looks something like:

As with any user default key, you can also set it on the command line for a particular session:

    /Path/To/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp -NSTraceEvents YES
