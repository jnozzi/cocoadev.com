I have an object called Crossword.  Inside this object I have typdef'ed a struct like this

    
typedef struct{
BOOL isSquareInCrossword;
General/NSString *letter;
BOOL isFirstLetterInWord;
}square;


I have declared an array of these squares
    
square crosswordBoard[50][50];


In regular C, inside the object, I can refer to (and assign values to) elements like this
    
crosswordBoard[30][15].isSquareInCrossword = 0;


I have a accessor method for crosswordBoard in the object Crossword.
    
-(square *)crosswordBoard
{
     return crosswordBoard;
}


How do I refer to the elements within crosswordBoard when I am in a different object?  In a different object, I declare
    
#include "Crossword.h"
...
General/IBOutlet   Crossword   crossword;


I tried
    
[crossword crosswordBoard][3][7].isSquareInCrossword=1;


This does not work for two reasons.  (1) something is wrong with the accessor method.  If you could tell me what I am doing wrong, that would be great. (2) the way I refer to the elements in crosswordBoard is not right.  Any suggestions on how to do this? --General/AlexanderD

In your accessor, you're returning a square *, not a square. Either of the following solutions should solve both the problems you specify above.

Either:
1. Change the return type of the accessor to square (not square *), which means you'd have to either dereference in the accessor or change the type in your class to square also.
2. OR (don't do both!) dereference whenever you use -crosswordBoard. (Like this:    (*[crossword crosswordBoard])[3][7].isSquareInCrossword = 1;

----

The first solution is not exactly what I need, because I want to pass an array of squares, not just one square.  I like the second idea, but the accessor method still does not work.  How do I change the accessor method so that what I return is really a (square *).  I am not so good at pointer stuff as you can see. --General/AlexanderD

If you are actually wanting to alter the state of the Crossword object then you really ought to write a method on Crossword that does it, it's bad karma to do what you seem to want to do! If you are trying to set a flag true / false to say if a square is 'in the crossword' then add something like this to the Crossword object.

    
- (void)setSquareAtRow:(int)aRow column:(int)aColumn isIncluded:(BOOL)aFlag
{
    crosswordBoard[aRow][aColumn].isSquareInCrossword = aFlag;
}

- (BOOL)isIncludedAtRow:(int)aRow column:(int)aColumn
{
    return crosswordBoard[aRow][aColumn].isSquareInCrossword;
}


Generally, you should not expose the innards of objects to the outside world as you don't know who could change it with disastrous consequences and all that. Excuse any typos /etc, I'm tired! I am sure you will understand what I mean.

----

You need to return a     (square[50][50]) from     crosswordBoard, not a pointer, since the latter doesn't work for 2D arrays.

----

This might seem silly, but why don't you use this?

    
typedef struct{
BOOL isSquareInCrossword;
char letter;
BOOL isFirstLetterInWord;
}square;


If letter is never going to be more then one character, why not avoid the extra overhead?  --General/DerekCramer

*Or use a     unichar instead of     char...it's basically the same, but it supports Unicode characters. --General/JediKnil*

If you want to initialize a structure in the following way, you have to use General/ObjectiveCPlusPlus (give your source implementation a .mm extension):

    
struct astruct
{
     int x;
     int y;
       
     astruct()
      {
         x=10;
         y=20;
       }
};


Or you can do it the C way if you're in plain Objective C:

    
typedef struct astruct {
    int x;
    int y;
} astruct;
...
astruct blah = { 10, 20 };

I want to use some C code in a standard Cocoa Objective-C app. I want to call the C stuff and get a returned array from it - I've tried just sticking the C code into my Obj-C file, but the compiler seems to choke on the "struct data{...}" and on pretty much everything else.

Edit: After some fiddling, I've it's only choking on this:

struct
{
     char x;
     char y;
     char z;
     char pad[57];
}data;

...

struct data inputStructure;

...

structureInputSize = sizeof(struct data);

The struct declaration works fine, whether or not I have a "typedef" before it; the second thing gives an "error: storage size of 'inputStructure' isn't known" and the third gives "error: invalid application of 'sizeof' to incomplete type 'struct blehData'".

----

General/ObjectiveC is C code. It's a superset, so you should be fine. 

Where exactly in the code did you add the "data" struct defintion? Hint: You need to add it before your code needs to use it.

----

It's before my method declaration, like so:

@implementation Tilter

General/NSString *bookModel;
struct
{
...
}data;

- (General/NSArray *)getTilt
{
...
struct data inputStructure;
...
structureInputSize = sizeof(struct data);
...
}

Edit: Aaand got it. struct data{ ... }; worked. Thanks.

----

Ah, my bad, I didn't notice you changed the "struct data" declaration.  Yeah, that will have stuffed it up.
