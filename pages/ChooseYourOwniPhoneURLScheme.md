iPhone applications can provide services to other applications by providing URL schemes; these schemes can be documented so that other applications can actually make use of these services. This page intends to be a place dedicated to this.

Reply to this page to document your own schemas. Feel free to copy the schemas above you as templates.

Before we start, **two definitions**: below, a **private scheme** is a scheme that *a single application* implements. You can be "sure" that only that application will be launched when using it. A **public scheme** is a scheme that *multiple applications* can implement, and that *you are encouraged to add to your own application*. This can be useful if a service can be provided by multiple apps and the application requesting the service does not want to tie to a single one of them.

These and more URL schemes are registered at http://handleOpenURL.com, a website aimed at servicing iPhone developers with a centralized index of used and usable URL schemes. If you have any ideas or would like to make contributions, pleas contact me at mailto:mwolzak@magnatron.nl

**x-infinitelabs-diceshaker:** -- A private URL scheme used by the Diceshaker application http://infinite-labs.net/diceshaker/ by EmanueleVulcano.

**Action: Posting a message**: This action is only available with Diceshaker 1.0.4 or later. When used, it will allow the user to roll dice in the Diceshaker application and return the result to the calling application. Diceshaker displays a "Send" and a "Cancel" message; both return to the calling application with an appropriate result.

To use, launch a URL of the form      x-infinitelabs-diceshaker:roll?<query> , where     <query> is a query string with the following key-value pairs:


* **sender**: *a string*, mandatory -- A short title identifying the application. Will be displayed to the user as part of a prompt.
* **returnURL**: *a return URL*, mandatory -- A correctly escaped string which, when decoded, is an URL that will be called with the result of the operation. See below.


When the user has finished rolling the dice and chooses a return option, the return URL provided above will be opened. The URL will be unmodified except that one or more key-value pairs will be added to the end of its query string part. If the URL appears to not have a query string part, then '?', followed by the result key-value pairs, will be appended at the end of it before opening it.

The items that will be appended are:


* **canceled**: *a string*, optional -- If present and if its value is equal to the string 'YES', then the user canceled the operation.
* **numberOfDice**: *an integer*, optional -- The number of dice that have been rolled. For example, if the user rolled three six-sided dice, this key's value is '3'. Present only if the user didn't cancel.
* **numberOfFacesPerDie**: *an integer*, optional -- The number of faces that each rolled die had. For example, if the user rolled three six-sided dice, this key's value is '6'. Present only if the user didn't cancel.
* **roll**: *an integer*, optional -- The sum of all rolled dice. For example, if the user rolled three six-sided dice, and the dice came up 3, 2 and 5, this key's value is '10'. Present only if the user didn't cancel. (Note that the value of individual dice is not returned to the caller, only the sum of the roll.)


http://www.screencast.com/users/millenomi/folders/Default/media/31390729-aabe-41da-a9e3-b48862095f7a shows an example of use of this action. Source code can be found at http://github.com/millenomi/iphone-ipc-sample-diceshaker/.

**instaviz:** -- A private URL scheme used in the diagram sketcher, Instaviz: http://instaviz.com by Pixelglow Software.      instaviz:  URL's always use an "inner" URL that expresses the graph you want to display, for now Instaviz understands      data: ,      http:  and      https:  inner URL's.

**Action: Display a graph embedded in the URL**: You can embed a graph in the URL using an inner      data:  URL and the DOT language. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme.

Launch a URL of the form      instaviz:data:,digraph G { hello -> world; } . Note that you will have to %-encode the usual punctuation for this to work from an app.

Launch a URL of the form      instaviz:data:;base64,ZGlncmFwaCBHIHsgaGVsbG8gLT4gd29ybGQ7IH0K . You can also base64-encode the graph so that the misaligned %-encoding bug will not prevent the URL from opening. If your graph has lots of punctuation, base64 encoding may actually be shorter.

**Action: Display a graph referenced by the URL**: You can reference a graph for Instaviz to download using an inner      http:  or      https:  URL.

Launch a URL of the form      instaviz:http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery/directed/fsm.gv.txt 

See http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html for how to compose graphs in the DOT language.
