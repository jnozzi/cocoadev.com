Formerly responsible for the MacZoop framework, for better or worse. I have seen the light and am no longer a slave to the language cult that is C++. I prefer these days to get work done rather than sacrificing virgins to the byzantine demands of Bjarne Stroustrup (fun though that might sound). I've been doing loads of Cocoa work for the last three years now and hopefully the community will shortly benefit from the fruits of my labours. Other ex-Zoopers here (i've seen there are a few) will know I've always been keen to give stuff away. God knows why, I'm still getting poorer by the day.

These days I live in Australia and I've become a father :)

I have now (September '06) started to build my website where I will be hosting Cocoa stuff for download as well as finished apps both old and new. Here's the link: http://apptree.net

Blasphemer! The C++ clan will exact revenge! But seriously, thanks for the code and congrats on fatherhood! --JeremyJurksztowicz

I don't fear them! They'll be too busy trying to write a generalised "exact revenge" template that can be used anywhere that any sort of revenge might want to be exacted on any type of transgressor. While they are busy doing that I can escape undetected..... --GC

As ambassador between the C++ clan and the Cocoa clan I must warn you that they have already installed an automatic shared reference on you. You cannot escape in a memory leak! Also they may invoke the monsterous Obj-C++ to create a deadly fast revenge program, with a beautiful user interface too. RECANT HERETIC! --JJ

One of the programming efforts I'm putting a lot of time into at the moment is GCDrawKit, an (eventually) open source framework for vector graphics. I believe I (and my fellow contributors) have come up with a genuinely powerful and ultimately useful architecture that will greatly benefit the Cocoa community. However, this project is quite big. So if you think you have what it takes to make a genuine contribution, I'd love to hear from you. Details on the drawkit page:

http://apptree.net/drawkit.htm

Note: I really need experienced programmers, and also help with documenting the thing. I really don't have time to help you out with baby steps, though naturally help with finding your way around the drawkit code itself will be generously given. On the other hand, if you don't know how to do MemoryManagement, or have never heard of invocation forwarding, etc, then it's probably not for you. While the framework is ultimately intended to be easy to make use of, it's necessarily quite complex in its internals. You have been warned!

Further note: Drawkit isn't an application as such, it's a framework on which a vector-type application can be built. I recently noticed some other people around here working on vector applications, apparently under the impression that a Cocoa-based Photoshop killer can be written in a few weeks. If drawkit were available today, I'd say that an Illustrator type app could be within reach with a few more months of effort, being realistic. These apps are dead hard. That's why drawkit itself has more modest goals - not to be an app, but a foundation on which a graphics app can be based. Even so it's fairly big and complex. I believe those who think a Photoshop (or Illustrator) killer is an easy task have either grossly underestimated what those apps are actually capable of, or else have overestimated their own abilities. So please be realistic!

The first publicly released fruit of the above DrawKit effort is released on http://gradientpanel.com (April 21, 2007). This is a complete UI for creating, editing and sharing gradients and is 100% free. The developer SDK is in the form of a universal binary framework and includes the Panel UI (GCGradientPanel), GCGradientWell and much enhanced version of GCGradient which actually renders the gradients (this can be used on its own if desired).

August 14, 2007: GCDrawKit public beta 1 is now ready for download. Refer to http://apptree.net/drawkitmain.htm --GC
