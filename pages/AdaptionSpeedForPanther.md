As a software developer, I am interested in how quickly I should jump on the new Panther features. I.e. will it take half a year before my potential users have upgraded to Panther?

Naturally it depends on the kind of users, but does anybody have any insight to how quick people are to upgrade?

Generally a massive proportion upgrade to start (perhaps 30-40%) and then over time that rises. At this time my server logs indicate 7% Panther (before release), 72% Jaguar, 8% Puma and 13% Mac OS 9 or Windows. At this time I am incorporating Panther features but making sure that I check the version of Mac OS X (they are coded features). I have all my software compatible back to 10.0 using this method.
