Does anyone know how to get/set the flag for a file's label in the finder? I was hoping it was just a simple attribute in NSFileWrapper, but it's not. Any ideas?
Thanks,

Have you looked at the AppleScript dictionary for the Finder?

Yeah, it says 
Class Label: (NOT AVAILABLE YET) A Finder label (name and color)

You'll probably have to use Carbon for this. [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Reference/IconServices/icon_services/function_group_10.html#//apple_ref/c/func/SetSuiteLabel]

If what you're working on is licensed under the GPL, you can use the source of the 'setlabel' utility, part of osxutils, to help you:

Couldn't you stick it in your bundle and call it via NSTask to avoid having to even think about the GPL?

Yep.
