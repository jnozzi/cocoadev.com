I want to add a .wdgt file (a Dashboard widget) as a resource into my application, so that I can have a menu item "Install widget..." that does this:

    
General/[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] openFile:General/[[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]] pathForResource:@"My Widget" ofType:@"wdgt"]];


However, when I import my widget into General/XCode, it is added to my application as a folder, not just as the bundled widget that it is in the Finder.  Since it's a folder, I can't add it to my target's Copy Bundle Resources build phase, and thus it isn't distributed in my app's bundle.  Is there any way to get this to work?  Thanks.

Select "Make folder references" instead of "Create groups" when you add the .wdgt, and you'll get a reference to the widget that you can add to the Copy Resources phase.

Works like a charm.  Thanks!
