Programming is easy.

Software development for Mac OS X can be a great joy. The advanced programming 
tools and frameworks now provided by Apple astound many programmers. When 
programmers delve into the object-oriented technology called Cocoa, which is part 
of every Mac OS X system, they often describe the experience as life-changing. 
Claims of massive productivity increases are common. Developers describe Cocoa as 
eye-opening. Cocoa demonstrates the true power of object-oriented programming in 
a way that few programmers have experienced when using other technologies. 
Cocoa enables programmers to focus on the unique value of their applications by 
eliminating almost all the drudgery traditionally necessary when making complex 
graphical applications. The Cocoa technology exemplifies some of the best software 
design ever seen. Beyond providing tremendous functionality out of the box, the 
Cocoa technology inspires programmers to follow Apple�s example and design excel- 
lent software.

Xcode:
When Apple designed Xcode, they kept you, the developer in mind, and so the aim was to provide a powerful and easy-to-learn development environment to address the needs of C and C++ Carbon-based, commercial developers. Apple also wanted this environment to support the use of Apple tools for migrating developer projects and enabling them to utilize everything Mac OS X has to offer.

Core Data:
Using Cocoa Makes It Easy
To illustrate how to take advantage of the new technologies in Tiger, we're going to do something a bit different and present the creation of a prototypical Cocoa application over a series of articles. This first article in this series covers the first few steps of creating our application, including putting together a data model and providing a user-interface. As we build up the application, we'll look at most of the new technologies in Tiger and how they can be utilized. When we're done, we'll have covered the spectrum of technologies that you should consider using in your own applications.

Automator:
The breakthrough that Automator brings is allowing you to assemble small tools in an easy, intuitive GUI. Anyone with scripting or development skills is a prime candidate for creating Actions, and in most cases they'll be able to do it much faster than scripting by hand.

A testimonial:
Grey Zone sends a message to anyone else considering development for Mac OS X. �If you�re a UNIX developer with a UNIX product and can find any way to support this platform, DO IT � the technical pieces are just so easy.� Daniel says. And Dave Harris adds, �Mac OS X is the best, most efficient platform out there for hosting a cost-effective solution.�
