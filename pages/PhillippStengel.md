I'm 15 years old an I'm from Germany (so my english isn't well sometimes). I started programming in the age of 12. My First Language was Visual Basic 5. After 2 years I moved to VB.net
But then I needed a website so it was time to learn a programming language for the web. Like the most people I first learned the basic of HTML and CSS so that was not enough for me so I started to learn PHP and MySQL. PHP is one of the easiest languages I've ever learned. I also used Javascript because it gives me interactiv contents without flash and it works in nearly every browser so its quite nice. PHP became my most used programming language and I wanted to switch away from Windows and I bought a Mac. I wanted to start programming and I did that. I bought the Mac Programming book of Aaron Hillegass it's a really good book. I also have a iPod Touch so iPhone/iPod Touch Development is a must for me. So thats everything about me.
