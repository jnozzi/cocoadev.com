I want to be able to download stock quotes into my application. I don't know where to start. Is there any information anywhere on this topic.

Thanks!

Do I have to add a browser view to my application??? This http downloads the data into a file on the desktop or wherever. How do you send the request from you application and get the received information into your application???? Is there any documentation on this anywhere???

Look up NSURL. That should be able to do what you need, without adding a webview to your project (i.e. doing it in the source code)
