General/TeXShop is a cocoa text editor and front end to the General/LaTeX macros for Knuth's General/TeX publishing system.

"General/TeXShop is a General/TeX previewer and editor for Mac OS X, written in Cocoa. Since PDF is a native file format on OS X, General/TeXShop uses "pdftex" and "pdflatex" rather than "tex" and "latex" to typeset".

The primary authors are Richard Koch, Max Horn and Dirk Olmes: The help of Many Others is acknowledged. Until recently, General/TeXShop users were advised to use Gerben Wierda's  i-Installer to the install the General/TeX machinery which does the actual typesetting, but from January 2007, the reccomendation has been General/MacTeX-2007 .
