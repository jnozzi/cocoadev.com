Yeah, it'll be really interesting to see what the CPU is. If the CPU doesn't support protected memory / address translation I think the chance of us seeing an SDK for the iPhone will drop dramatically. 

Apple has said that there won't be any third-party apps on the iPhone, much like the iPod.

Apple representatives on the show floor said that the iPhone is currently a closed platform, but that Developers wanting to develop for the iPhone platform should contact ADC to register their interest.

----

Correct. But much like the iPod, I don't think it's going to matter how many developers "register their interest" - if the hardware can't provide a robust platform for developers we will not be seeing an SDK. Perhaps iPhone2.0 or iPhone2.5....

Lets wait and see anyway.

----

It's for that reason (and the insane price tag) that I won't be buying one any time soon. They will have to 1) open it up to third party development and 2) either lower the price or *significantly* increase the storage for that price.
----
If it isn't supporting third party s/w..i wont be buying it!

My goodness thats a silly decision.  It'll kill the iPhone in the power-user market.

Looks like we'll be waiting for Steve Jobs to retire before we can write software for it!

I really love Steve but I'm puzzled by his strange comments about "bringing down the entire West Coast network"... I'm not sure what he means by that.  I don't think it's possible for a single app to bring down the network... potentially a malicious app could start dialing and maybe there could be somekind of mass timed dialing resulting in a DOS but I've never heard of a smartphone app shutting down a cellular network.  I could see Apple being afraid that an app could do bad things to the iPhone (i.e. hijack the screen and not let it go forcing you to reboot) but that's a risk me and a BUNCH of other people would be willing to take.

----

A DoS attack could take down a network. That's probably what he had in mind when he made that statement.

----
Ok fine.  But... the same could have happened with any of the OTHER smartphones.  And AFAIK it's never happened.  If anything, the iPhone should be less vulnerable to that kind of thing because presumably it runs some sort of OS X which has fairly advanced privileges -- meaning my guess is that it's harder for an app on an iPhone to gain unauthorized dialing privelleges than it is for an app on most other smartphones.

----
Utter foolish nonsense. The bandwidth alloted to *a single phone* is nowhere near enough to bring down the network. That'd be like trying to perform a DoS attack on Google by hammering it with requests from a single dial-up connection. * -- That kinda goes without saying.* The only "S" you're "D'ing" is your own - Google wouldn't even notice your efforts. Now a virus spreading to multiple phones could be used to create a DDoS attack (the extra "D" is for "distributed", kiddies), but there is equal danger of that happening with **any phone**, not even just smart phones. 

I believe there are two big reasons they want it closed: 1) there is no solid SDK so no easy way for developers to create a stable app that doesn't devour battery power, etc. and thereby make the phone "less attractive" or easy to use and, 2) it's very likely that their deal with Cingular has placed some restrictions on what their network is used for, how it's used, and how easy it is for the phone to be 'unlocked'.

----
-- which is exactly what I meant when I said "mass timed dialing

----
... which is, as I said, no more a danger than with any other phones, smart or no.

----
I like the SDK theory... and I'm kinda willing to believe the "get your filthy developer paws off our iPhone" theory... but I don't get what Cingular has to gain -- the more traffic they get the more $$$... so... not seeing that.  But, maybe it could be that Cingular is developing a new protocol for cellphones to talk to the network (something serious that the visual voicemail feature might be hinting at) and they want to keep that protocol under wraps before it's matured.

----

If every other cell phone maker on the planet provides an SDK why can't Apple? Thats the question Apple needs to answer. 


----
It may be ugly.  I don't just mean ugly to look at / use, I mean ugly in that they may be looking to update it in ways that would break backwards compatability.  It's a brand spankin' new environment for them and I could understand Apple not wanting to have a mass user base of an interface that they really want to change.  That said, I STILL can't understand why Steve said what he said -- why not just come out with the real reason(s) instead of treating us like idtios and feeding us completely bogus story.

----
That's pretty much what I've been saying.  Steve's comments just don't make sense.  It's okay to be wrong, and it's okay to have a slip up once in a while... but bullshitting is just not cool.

----
I saw another interesting possibility on digg.  Apple doesn't want third party developers competing in what may be a small market space.  The number of possible (and useful) iPhones apps besides those Apple is already providing may be farily limitted.

----
I don't buy it. I've owned computers that were less capable and more expensive than the iPhone in every imaginable respect (with the lack of a keyboard being one exception), and yet somehow they had dynamic, vibrant third party software markets. The presentation maybe a phone but the hardware is a full-up computer and a full-up computer with a high-res screen, multi-touch input, wifi, and access to cell data networks has an enormous potential for third-party apps. Apple may have good reasons for not wanting to open the platform, but "there aren't enough non-competing niches" is completely bogus.

----

The market for PalmOS and Windows Mobile applications is VERY large. The iPhone would be no different.

----
Well, I threw it out there -- but I have to agree...  not a plausible explanation.

----
It's always good to see more possibilities, one of them might stick. Take no offense when we rip it to shreds. :-)
