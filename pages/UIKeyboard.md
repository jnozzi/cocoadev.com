Part of the iPhone General/UIKit framework. Subclass of General/UIView.

<code>+ (void)initImplementationNow;</code>

Must be called before initWithFrame?

<code>- (id)initWithFrame:(General/CGRect)frame;</code>

        General/[UIKeyboard initImplementationNow];
  General/UIKeyboard *keyboard = General/[[UIKeyboard alloc] initWithFrame: General/CGRectMake(0.0f, 245.0f,
                                                              320.0f, 480.0f - 245.f)];
//Call up your keyboard into your mainView created as a General/UIWindow
mainView = General/[[UIView alloc] initWithFrame: rect];



enum values for setDefaultReturnKeyType:

    

0 = Return (gray background)
1 = Go (blue background)
2 = Google (blue background)
3 = Join (blue background)
4 = Next (gray background)
5 = Route (blue background)
6 = Search (blue background)
7 = Send (blue background)
8 = Yahoo! (blue background)



To change the keyboard layout, use one of the below enums for setPreferredKeyboardType, followed with a call to showPreferredLayout: 

    

0 = default QWERTY layout
1 = numeric/punctuation layout
2 = phone keypad
3 = URL layout
4 = SMS (?) layout, shift disabled, num key goes to phone keypad
5 = black version of default layout
6 = spartan phone keypad
7 = black spartan (clean!)
8 = email keypad w/ space key
9 = email keypad w/ @ instead of space



As an aside, if you're using General/UIAlert, be sure to set popupAlertAnimated:NO otherwise your showPreferredLayout will be overridden with the default layout. For example:

    

      [myAlert popupAlertAnimated:NO];
      [[myAlert keyboard] setPreferredKeyboardType: 1];
      [[myAlert keyboard] showPreferredLayout];
