After changing the effects of an image by reducing its size or saturation, how to save that altered image as an image file?

----

If you're working with an NSImage, ask for a representation (which is given to you as an NSData) and write that out as you would any NSData. This information becomes immediately apparent when you read the documentation for NSImage.

Actually in my application I am using CIImage. Then how to save the CIImage into a file?

----

Simply wrap the CIImage in an NSCIImageRep, add that to an NSImage, and go from there.

I can save the image and open it in Preview application when I don't apply any filters for the image. But when I applied the filters(like CIBlur, CIDistortionEffect etc) to the image I could able to save the image, but I could not able to open the image in preview application.
