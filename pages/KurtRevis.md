*Describe KurtRevis here.*

Bah! All in one little text view?



I'm an engineer at TheOmniGroup, which is apparently a company some of you have heard of! I've been there since 1998, and have worked on a great variety of Cocoa, EnterpriseObjectsFramework, and WebObjects applications.

Before that I did "classic" MacOS programming for a few years, so these days I can definitely find my way around Carbon if I have to. Happily, that's almost never the case.

(And before that I had the usual mismash of college computing... wrote a few database-backed web sites back when that was actually a novel idea... and at some point in the foggy past went to the public library and paid $1/hour to use an Apple II!)

Cocoa is great. Unfortunately, I've found that it can also be somewhat obscure, especially to the uninitiated. I hope I can provide some sort of useful information here.
