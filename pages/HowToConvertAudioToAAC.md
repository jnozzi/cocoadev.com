I need a way to convert an audio file (usually an MP3) to an AAC file. Is iTunes (via AppleScript) the best way to do this? Or is there a framework out there that can do this? Thanks --KevinWojniak

I'm not sure, but QuickTime is probably your best bet. --zootbobbalu

Why convert an MP3 to AAC?

*To gain AAC's ability for bookmarking.*

Last time I checked, only Audible.com's audiobooks can do that.  Not AAC.

Nope, it's possible for any AAC file - [http://www.malcolmadams.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=makebookmarkable]
