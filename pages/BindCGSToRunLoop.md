Has anyone got any ideas why NSRunLoop or actually CFRunLoop crashes with the following backtrace when running on 10.2? I'm trying to do a cmd-line only, no-GUI application. It's running on a server, which doesn't have a GUI session running. I run it over ssh. On my local 10.3 box the program works just fine.

I couldn't even find any mention of BindCGSToRunLoop one the web with Google ar Altavista.

The abbreviation CGS seems to refer to the window server. It sounds like something in your app is making it want to start a session with the window server, but there is no window server connection available, and that's making it crash. Could be completely off-base, but that's what it sounds like from the information you've provided.

Yes, this is probably what it was. The component responsible for this was CURLHandle.framework. I had to replace it with AGSocket and custom HTTP code to get rid of the window server dependency. WebKit would've been an option, but it had a strange bug that prevented it from working with the particular server I am using with this software. (I didn't get any of my delegate methods called when the server was asking for HTTP Authentication, non-secure pages worked fine. And Safari works fine with that server.)

What I'm doing here is that I'm pulling messages from a FirstClass server and putting them to a PostgreSQL database. Then a PHP script generates a RSS feed from the contents of the database. I'm planning on making this software open source and available to all interested parties (probably about one and a half people :).

I'm curious why you've chosen to do this with Cocoa? Wouldn't just doing the whole thing in PHP/Python/Perl/whatever be better?

Coz I'm lovin' it! :) There actually was a PHP version, but it I converted it to Cocoa and expanded on that. I'm sick and tired of my badly written PHP scripts which can't be deciphered after about a month of not actively working with the code. A nice class model in Cocoa is so much more readable and modifiable. I feel that I'm more productive and produce better results when using Cocoa. Another reason is that I wanted to do a GUI that lets me browse the results of the actual program's work. The PHP script used to generate the RSS is there just because I was so lazy and I didn't want to code a RSS generator myself (I would have to handle embedding HTML inside the XML and so on).

And hey, if anybody is interested in this software, please say so.
