Example code for server and client threads communication using DistributedObjects. 

The code is based on Apple article (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/articles/CocoaDOComm.html) and DistributedObjectsForInterThreadCommsCrash.

Notes:


* The DO voodoo is hidden in Server class, the client need only one method for setting the server
* Does not leak mach ports like Apple example code


Issues:


* It would be nice to hide the DO voodoo completely and create the worker thread with [Server server]
* It would be nice to create the server thread synchronically, blocking until it is created.

/* 

Creating a server thread
------------------------
Client call [Server connectionToServerThreadForClient:self] to create a
server thread and get back a connection to the thread. When the thread
is ready, it will call the client setServer: method. After the client
set the server, it can communicate with the server over DO.

Destroying a server thread
--------------------------
Client call [server terminate], then release the server as usual.
