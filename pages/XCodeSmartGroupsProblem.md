I am having a problem with General/XCode 2.4 where the errors after building do not show up in the Errors and Warnings smartgroup. Warnings do show up. In other words, the build will claim like 1 error, 4 warnings, but will not list the error in the detail list. I cannot find any setting in prefs or elsewhere to affect this, nor is there anything relevant in General/XCode's help that I can see. I am a newbie though so maybe I am just doing something stupid. Any suggestions?
