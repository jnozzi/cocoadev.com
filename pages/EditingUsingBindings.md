When I add a new item to my TableView using bindings, it currently places the Null Placeholder value of "Untitled" in the table view however I want to make it where when a user clicks the button, which is bound to add of that table column, that it is editable initially so i can type in a custom name.  I also want to do something other than go down to edit the next value in the column when a user presses enter.  Can someone show me how i would go about doing this?
