I have a single tablecolumn. Each row of the table column should have a NSRelevance type level indicator and its height should be lesser than the row height. Can anyone help me out.

Don't really parse your statement "Each row [height] of the table column should ... be lesser than the row height"...but NSTableView has the following method:

- (void)setRowHeight:(float)rowHeight

If you mean the NSLevelIndicator, then this is derived from NSCell in a table column so have a look at the documentation for that class.
