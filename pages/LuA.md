LuA (Spelled "Lua", the Portuguese word for "moon", from Latin "luna") is a cool scripting language built to run within existing applications. It's main purpose is to contain preferences, but it can do so much more.
The main website that hosts Lua version 5 is http://www.lua.org, and they also have a wiki.

Lua was also one of the main inspirations for IoLanguage; if you like Lua, you might like IoLanguage as well, and on OS X, IoLanguage has a nice ObjC bridge. It's nice seeing well-designed languages like Lua and Io interoperate with Cocoa, isn't it?

If someone created a Lua-ObjC bridge, I'd be in heaven. All I want is a few functions to change between NSDictionaries and all the basic data-types (NSString, NSNumber) and their Lua counterparts... Lua is a wonderful language. I think everyone should give it a shot. --RossLeonardy

Wow. That's better code then I could ever write *sniff*... it's so beautiful!  Mind if I change it a bit? I think that perhaps instead of returning an int for a Boolean type (I'm only looking at the last function right now)  you (and others that use this code) might want to change it to a BOOL. But maybe the increase isn't worth the extra "if" statements. Also, um... I think you forgot to include Foundation.h. Meh, it's easier to be a critic then to be someone who actually does something about it.

Please feel free to make whatever changes you see fit, and to use it in any way you like. I've released it as public domain. --ToM

Let me get this straight -- this ObjectiveC bridge must be compiled into the LuA implementation directly, right? It isn't an Addon for ... <ahem> ... existing LuA implementations?

Also, 

*Meh, it's easier to be a critic then to be someone who actually does something about it.*

I thought the opening statement said it all: * Wow. That's better code then I could ever write *sniff*... it's so beautiful!  Mind if I change it a bit?* ROTFL!

The bridge can be be incorporated into Objective-C projects (e.g. as a plugin), or it can be compiled as a loadable library for existing LuA implementations. -- ToM.

You might want to give Wax a shot, it's a Lua ObjC bridge. It's designed primarily for the iOS devices, but can easily work with any Apple Device. http://github.com/probablycorey/wax
