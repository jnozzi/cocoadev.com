General/TestKit

What specific needs? What's different from the xUnit style unit-testing framework?  How/Why would a developer choose between General/TestKit and General/ObjCUnit or General/OCUnit?

*Tell us please!*

I agree that information like this would be very useful. However, information like this *from the author* is always biased and never truly useful. I do encourage others to answer these questions -- General/TimHart

It'd be a start, though, Tim. Right now it might as well be vapourware, but for that link.

Tim - there is if nothing else a question of goals.  Why do you find General/ObjCUnit and General/OCUnit to be insufficient for you?  What are you attempting to address?  None of us will be able write anything balanced if we aren't even convinced to try it out. 

What are the goals of this testing system? What is the difference from the existing solutions?
