X<nowiki/>codeKeyboardShortcuts is a list of keyboard shortcuts and a brief description of what the function of the keyboard shortcut.

*Note: It should be mentioned that you can *customize* each and every shortcut in the app (and add new ones for any menu item you want) by selecting Preferences->Key Bindings.*


**ANNOTATED KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS**
* **Command-[** = shift selected text left by one tab
* **Command-]** = shift selected text right by one tab
* **Control-/ = *Jump to Next Placeholder.* **  When using auto complete, often one ends up with lines of text featuring placeholders that look like this,      <#General/NSString * title#> .  When you have multiple placeholders as such, you can jump to the next placeholder by pressing this key combination.  It should be noted that when you reach the last placeholder for a given statement Xcode cycles back to the first placeholder in said statement. *Ahh, very nice. I always wondered if there was a way to do this!*
* **CONTROL-OPTION-COMMAND-UP or DOWN = *Next and Previous Detail* **   The project window is consists of two main views: the groups and files view on the left side, and the detail view on the right. Clicking on any group in the groups and files view causes the items in that group to be displayed in the detail view. The Next Detail and Previous Detail commands are used to select the item after or before the currently selected item. These commands are really only useful as keyboard shortcuts since when you're using the mouse it's generally faster to click on the item you want to select than to choose a command from a menu. Also, when using these commands you'll want to have the detail view split, so that you can see the content of the selected item. (It would be awfully nice if these commands, along with the Next File and Previous File commands, worked in the Documentation window.)
