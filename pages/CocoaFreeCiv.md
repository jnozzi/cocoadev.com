While cleaning out an old disk, I found a project that I experimented with some time ago. Since there is no way I'll find the time to finish it, I might as well pass it on:

A Cocoa client for FreeCiv 
Based on an original port by Brian Bolson who apparently stopped developing it, I started cleaning and refactoring it but got distracted. Time (a year or so...) passed and it was forgotten.

I've just compiled and run it under 10.2.3 and it looks like I left it in the middle of rerouting nib connections... d'oh! It runs, its somewhat playable but needs a lot of work. The port is based on an outdated version of FreeCiv but should provide a good starting point.

Anyone feeling like giving it a go, please drop me a note, it is yours for the taking!
