**WHO AM I?**

I've a native of the Pacific Northwest, who's been working with computers since I was in 3rd grade.  Beginning with BASIC, moving to Pascal, I've since gone through C, FORTH, LISP, Alef, C++, Perl, Java, Python, Objective-C, and far too many scripting languages to count.  I also try to write speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy, etc.) and I do art (badly) in 2d mediums and in 3d with Lightwave.  I am also an equestrian, riding English-style with a focus on hunter/jumper.  The horse I generally ride is a bratty quarterhorse who eats everything, including my sweatshirts.  

I have been compared, both in appearance and in personality, to the character Freda from the comic *Ban the Basics* -- http://banthebasics.keenspace.com/ -- and so I stuck a picture of Freda at the top of this page.  (Yes, the artist gave permission.)

I live in the Fremont area of Seattle, reknowned for our cement troll lurking under the bridge, a decommissioned missile on the roof of a building, a statue of Lenin saved from the falling Soviet Union and placed in one of our parks, and numerous other oddities.  We're right on the water -- with the Adobe campus eating a chunk of the waterfront -- and have an odd mixture of trendy buildings and expensive sushi places sitting huddled next to dusty little bookstores and artisans' shops and restaurants.  Fremont is the self-declared 'Center of the Universe' and one of the best places in the Seattle area to live, as far as I'm concerned.  Wouldn't mind meeting a few other OS X coder-sorts in the area, though!

My first computer related paycheck was at Microsoft, I'm afraid to admit, and working support for the Windows 9x team, no less.  I've also been a multimedia engineer, a database engineer, a video game programmer and designer (for three years!), a security programmer, and written a compiler/assembler and silicon simulator for an adaptive microchip.  These days, I work at a company called Cerulean Studios on an instant messaging package for Windows called Trillian -- http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/ -- and so still exist on my Windows box during day-to-day life.

I take some small pride in the fact that I have converted both my two best friends and my mother to MacOS X users -- leading both to purchase Macs -- by allowing them to play with my Powerbook G4.  Muahah.

**WHAT ARE MY PROJECTS?**

I've tinkered with various little software projects, though I'm getting the feel of Cocoa still.  The main project I'm working on is **Atlantis**, a client for MacOS X designed to connect to various text-based interactive environments (such as MUSHes, MUXes, MUCKs, MOOs and so on).  Atlantis is still in the fairly early stages, in part because I keep deciding there's a better way to do things and ripping out what I had so far!

I've also written several frameworks to make my own life easier, and should get around to documenting and releasing a few of them at some point, no doubt.

I also have hacked together a few Perl and shell scripts to make my Mac experience happy, the most notable to other developers being the hack found at XcodeAndNibFilesWithPerforce here on the CocoaDev WikiWikiWeb.
