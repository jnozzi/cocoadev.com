I'm trying to write a program that will intercept keystrokes no matter what program you are currently using so that I can make custom hotkeys. Does anybody know how to do this? I saw that there were other discussions about this topic but I thought maybe someone would see this new topic in recent changes and might know the answer.

If you do a search here on cocoadev for 'hotkey', you'll find lots of stuff.  I've had success with 
Quentin Carnicelli's hotkey stuff at http://www.rogueamoeba.com/~qdc/pub/osx/CocoaHotKeys2.tgz  ++MarkDalrymple

Awesome! Thanks a lot.

Not entierely sure it's Intel compatible though. - JeanOlivierLanctot

It appears to work well on Intel for me although the source tends to throw a few errors when compiled.  These are simple to fix, so I'd recommend using it. -G
