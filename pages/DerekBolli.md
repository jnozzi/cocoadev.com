Thanks to this site and reference books like BookCocoaProgramming
and BookCocoaRecipes I am happily porting all my Classic apps to
Cocoa and Objective-C

ob. quote: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one
persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends
on the unreasonable man."
