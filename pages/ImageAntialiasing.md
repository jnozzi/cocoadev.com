I have a number of pdf images which are normally rendered at full page with complete antialiasing and are properly antialiased when scaled by the finder/webkit/NSImageView etc.  In a NSView subclass I load the image and draw it in my view with drawInRect:fromRect:operation:fraction: using the NSCompositeSourceOver operation, and it renders all pixely (even with other compositing modes)... is there a way to turn on antialiasing that I am missing?

Antialiasing is very slow for most purposes... If you need your images antialiased however: [[NSGraphicsContext currentContext] setImageInterpolation:NSImageInterpolationHigh];
