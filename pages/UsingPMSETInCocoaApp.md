I need to use pmset in my app, but when I use the 'schedule' argument, it just says "Badly formatted date". However, if I use 'repeat', it works fine. Here's my code:

    
General/NSTask *task = General/[NSTask launchedTaskWithLaunchPath:@"/usr/bin/sudo" arguments:General/[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"pmset", @"schedule", @"wake", @"'03/18/07 15:00:00'", nil]];

I know that's not the best way to use sudo, but it works fine for testing. :) I just have to make sure sudo is "unlocked" before using it.


Anyway, it seems like the problem might be that there's a space in between the date and the time, so it thinks it's two arguments. Does anyone have suggestions? Thanks in advance.

Remove the single quotes from your date. You are confusing shell argument escaping with direct UNIX arguments which require no such quoting.

See General/NSTaskArguments.

Cool, it works! Thank you.
