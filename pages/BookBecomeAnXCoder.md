Bert Altenburg, author of "AppleScript for Absolute Starters", in co-operation with AlexClarke and Philippe Mougin, has released a new book, "Become an Xcoder", for newcomers to Cocoa programming using Objective-C and XCode. 

This tutorial is for non-programmers, and is aimed at levelling the learning curve as much as possible. In the best tradition, the tutorial is being released as a free booklet in PDF format.
