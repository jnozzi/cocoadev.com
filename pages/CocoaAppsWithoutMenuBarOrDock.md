What is the easiest way to have an app that doesn't display any menu bar or it's icon in the dock, only a status item. I can do the the status item. I just need to know how to do the rest.

Easy to do. In project builder, goto the 'Project' menu, select 'Edit Active Target "Project Name"'. Select 'Expert View' out of the 'Info.plist Entries'. Add to this list, LSUIElement with a number value of 1.


Enjoy!
