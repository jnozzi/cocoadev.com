Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented language that has borrowed much of its syntax from Eiffel (LanguageEiffel) and Ada, and its thinking from SmallTalk.
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/index.html

Different from most OO languages, everything in Ruby is an object, even numeric literals. Ruby sports Java-style exceptions, single-inheritance and modules (categories) ï¿½ la Objective-C, dynamic method binding like Java and JavaScript, and the capability to send blocks of code as a parameter to a method (closures).

A version of Ruby for Apache exists: mod_ruby, which enables you to serve Ruby pages, similar to mod_perl, PHP, or ASP.

RubyCocoa combines Ruby and Cocoa.

rb-appscript [http://rb-appscript.rubyforge.org] allows Ruby to control scriptable applications in place of AppleScript.

Has anyone got the RubyCocoa Tiger installer to work correctly?

Does anyone know which version of Mac OS X first shipped with Ruby installed?

According to this page... http://rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyOnMacintosh

10.2: Ruby 1.6.7

10.3: Ruby 1.6.8

10.4: Ruby 1.8.2

*Strictly speaking, isn't that LexicalClosure**'s rather than coroutines?*

I think so - coroutines aren't supported natively by languages these days. I've changed the text. See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine

I do not know Ruby, but I would be wary about changing this if you don't know.  Python, for example, definitely *does* natively support coroutines, in the form of the "yield" statement.

Ruby also supports coroutines through the yield mechanism.

In answer to the earlier question, I have gotten the tiger version of ruby to work. I believe my commands at RubyCocoaTutorial still download and install the latest version. Though covered in grammatical errors, I'd say it's pretty nice :> - Ross Leonardy
