What is the best way to implement disappearing views just like in PB or IE? -- peacha

----

[view removeFromSuperview] ??? What effect are you looking for exactly?

----

I would like to make it slide away. Also, does anyone know how to get vertical tabs in IB (I mean without coding it)??? IB has the "direction" option disabled for any NSTabView) -- peacha

----

Are you talking about an NSSplitView ?

About the vertical tabs, not only does IB not show it but the apple documentation also says that they are not implemented -- HaRald

----
A summary of some threaded discussion:
Vertical tabs are supported in IB as of Jaguar.
