Like VersionTracker except:

 
* It's Mac-only (although it lists the few OS9 updates that still come out mixed in with the OSX listing.)
* Its email-when-this-app-is-updated membership services are free. (*Jan 2006: Not so free any more.*)
* You don't have to click through multiple pages to download something.
