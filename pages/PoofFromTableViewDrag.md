So I currently have tableview to tableview drag and drop all sorted in my app - first time i've done any drag and drop stuff as it happens. And I want to be able to drag things out of my tableview and have them disappear in a poof animation like the dock.

Any pointers on where to begin?

Thanks a lot for your help, it's much appreciated! Seriously!
