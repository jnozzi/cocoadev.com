Hello Everyone, I am developing a document based Cocoa Application. In my application Open Recent(in File Menu) is not being populated with file names.As I read it must be generated automatically, but it is not showing the file names. Can we populate the file names programatically(which will be added to open recent menu) or Is there any other way to do this?

See the bottom of SavingDataWithoutNSDocument for information about manually dealing with the menu.  We may need more detail to diagnose why your documents are not being handled automatically.
