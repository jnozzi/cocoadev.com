I have recently changed my data model structure, and am looking for a way to determine if any of my old array controllers are still bound to objects in my nib file. I have tons of bindings in my application and it would take entirely too long to go through the bindings one-by-one. I simply need to delete the "unused" Entities in my .xcdatamodel file to clean it up without breaking any bindings that may still exist with those entities. Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
