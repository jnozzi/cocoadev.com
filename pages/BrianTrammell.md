I've been a Mac user for 15 years, and have been learning Cocoa on and off (mostly off) in my spare time over the last year or so. I'm a Java refugee from the dotcom days, and I hack ANSI/POSIX C at my day job, but even given my limited experience, I far prefer working with Cocoa. I'm just getting started building some non-toy software for the platform; check back as I'm planning to release what I do throw together open source.
