Calendar Store is a framework that allows Cocoa applications to access iCal data. You can fetch iCal records�such as calendars, events, and tasks�and receive notifications when these records change in iCal. You can also make some local changes to records and save them to the Calendar Store database. This document describes Calendar Store concepts and common programming tasks.
