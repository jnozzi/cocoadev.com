***Description:**
As you begin developing for Mac OS X, you'll face major changes, lots of difficult decisions, and also some terrific opportunities. The Mac OS X Developer's Guide aims to do more than help you make the transition painlessly: It's dedicated to helping you capitalize on these opportunities and positively thrive in this new environment. Inside is the background you need to get started, the instruction and examples you need to move forward, and the expert advice you need to solve your toughest programming challenges. At a stage where others may struggle to get up to speed, you can work more efficiently while building more powerful, more usable, more robust applications. That?s the beauty of Mac OS X, and of the Mac OS X Developer?s Guide.

----**Comments**----


* SteveWainstead: This is not a terrible book, but it's probably overly broad. It's huge and covers everything in a way that seems to suggest the author assumes the reader does not have a computer science degree.
----
* Most of us don't.
----
* So true.
----
* See [http://cocoa.mamasam.com/COCOADEV/2001/10/2/16495.php] for a discussion of this book. Not very enticing.

* I haven't seen this one, but I have this author's Rhapsody book and while it was useful 4 years ago when the only other docs available were a few recycled NeXT PDFs from Apple, that doesn't make it a good book. The API reference section was essentially a list of method names without arg or return types, and no description forthcoming. I also spotted a few errors, even back then in my newB state. This book would have to be 5000% better to even be worth borrowing.
