From about 2-4 February 2005, the RecentChanges page got messed up and was sorting new dates toward the bottom of the list. Since the fix was apparently simple, I've created this page to preserve it in case the same thing happens again.

...To clarify, it's creating the days out of order, with each new day appearing at the bottom.

Hi, I don't know why that is happening. I haven't made any changes to the script in months. I'll see if I can figure anything out. -- StevenFrank

Oh, I remember this problem. You need to have a %%LIN<nowiki/>E%% above the automatic date part. Let's see if that does it in a few hours.

Actually, we can test it right now by (temporarily) deleting everything from the third.

Yep, that did it!
