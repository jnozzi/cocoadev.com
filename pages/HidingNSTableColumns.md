Anybody knows how to hide and show programmatically NSTableColumns? It isn't apparent how to do this from the docs, although I suspect I have to remove the objects from the table columns through NSTableView's methods. Is that so?

Yes. To hide, remove the column completely. To show, reinsert it. Remember to retain it before taking it out, otherwise it will be destroyed.

Thank you thousand for the clarification. -- l0ne
