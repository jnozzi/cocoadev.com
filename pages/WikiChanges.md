Feel free to add more stuff that should/could be done here.


== Things that should to be done ==

Every page should to be checked and (<nowiki>*</nowiki>)'s in the page source need to be replaced with (*)'s where appropriate. (usually in code blocks)

The importer inserted internal links in <nowiki>    </nowiki> blocks these should to be removed because it screws up the code.
    
 *For example:*
 General/NSString *aString = General/[NSString stringWithString:@"Test"];
 *Is invalid code and needs to be changed to:*
 NSString *aString = [NSString stringWithString:@"Test"];

 
All pages should be checked and <nowiki>    </nowiki> tags should be added where they are missing.

All external links should be checked to see if they are broken up with internal links:

 *to:*

Also consider updating the pages to use correct mediawiki headers, etc.


Suggested procedure for these changes is to go to General/Special:AllPages pick a section and work your way through it.


----
Templates such as General/Template:Languages are broken because the following extension is not installed: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ParserFunctions

Perhaps this extension should be installed? (If this is indeed the case.)


== Things that could be done ==
Improve the <nowiki><syntaxhighlight></nowiki> plugin CSS and replace all <nowiki>    </nowiki> blocks with it. (Currently the font kinda sucks, imo.)


== Things that might make sense ==
Possibly move all the conversations on a page into its talk page?
