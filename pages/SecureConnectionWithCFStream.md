I'm using AsyncSocket to do some custom networking in my application.  I want to add support for secure connections via TLS, but can't get it to work.  I was under the impression that all I had to add was the following:

    
// This method gets called prior to opening the stream
- (BOOL)socketWillConnect:(AsyncSocket *)sock
{
	CFReadStreamSetProperty([sock getCFReadStream], kCFStreamPropertySocketSecurityLevel, kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNegotiatedSSL);
	CFWriteStreamSetProperty([sock getCFWriteStream], kCFStreamPropertySocketSecurityLevel, kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelNegotiatedSSL);
	
	return YES;
}


I wanted to test it to see if it works, so I slapped together a tiny little test to download a webpage.  It was pretty easy after reading this blog post:
http://deusty.blogspot.com/2006/12/statefull-downloading.html

First I tested it by downloading regular (http, not https) webpages.  Everything worked perfectly.  But when I try to get the paypal homepage (https:www.paypal.com - port 443) I always get an error message.  More specifically, a 302 status message, with this in the header: Location = "https://www.paypal.com/mod_ssl:error:HTTP-request";

Everything LOOKS like it's working correctly, but I'm not able to connect to any https servers online.  Am I missing something?

302 is not an error code. It's a redirect code (see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html):

*
10.3.3 302 Found

The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.
*

AFAIK a web client should follow a location header and try and load the URL pointed to by the location field.
I've no idea how this is handled by CFStream.

Hope this helps,

Yes, I'm aware of what a 302 status code means.  Which is why I provided the Location header as well, which includes "mod_ssl:error:HTTP-request".  This isn't a redirect.  Because trying to load this page also results in a 302 status code, with the exact same Location header.  In fact, this is the exact same response I get if I try to load the page without configuring any secure connection what-so-ever.  This leads me to the conclusion that I'm not getting the SSL connection right.

So my initial question remains: Am I missing something?

Well, it is a redirect, but one likely caused by some error in your request which is confusing Apache.  I'm not sure what you're doing, but if I use openssl as a manual client, and provide the following request, everything works for me:

    
GET https://www.paypal.com/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.paypal.com

Your problem may be that the AsyncSocket delegate method is called onSocketWillConnect: and not socketWillConnect:

:)

This would explain your 302 status code, because security is not being configured on the streams if this method isn't being called.
Also, as a side-note, that blog tutorial was very informative...however...it depends on a Content-Length header.
Doing a quick "curl --verbose https://www.paypal.com" in the terminal reveals that this particular site uses chunked transfer encodings, and thus doesn't have a Content-Length header.

Not sure if you care about this, since you said you were just downloading the page for testing purposes.  If you do, there is a good explanation of how you would go about parsing the HTTP body here: http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#http1.1c2

Wow.  I'm an idiot.  (Although, I have no idea how I messed that up.  I swear I copied and pasted from previous working code)

Thanks for pointing out my mistake.  It fixed the problem.
