DocoaBrowser is a utility application that displays Apple's Cocoa framework documentation (both Java and Objective-C flavors) as well as your own AutoDoc documentation. AutoDoc documentation can be displayed from HTML files as well generated on the fly from your Objective-C project directory (AutoDoc 2.0b8 is included in DocoaBrowser's bundle) .

DocoaBrowser is based on CocoaBrowser by Hoshi Takanori and others and is now hosted at Source Forge
