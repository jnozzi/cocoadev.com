Hey, thanks for stopping by.

My name is Todd Harris.  (http://stein.cshl.org/~todd/)

I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (http://www.cshl.org/. )

My graduate training is in genetics and molecular biology, but I'm now primarily doing research in the vast area of bioinformatics and comparative genomics.  I'm working in the lab of Lincoln Stein, developer of, among other things, the ubiquitous CGI.pm.

I'm currently writing some small and simple 'net friendly data management and analysis tools for molecular biologists.
