I am using MGTwitterEngine (mattgemmell.com/2008/02/22/mgtwitterengine-twitter-from-cocoa) and I need to display the tweets that are download as an Array in a textField or tableView. I would post the code here however, there are multiple files and I'm not 100% sure which is needed to display the tweets.


Thanks!
