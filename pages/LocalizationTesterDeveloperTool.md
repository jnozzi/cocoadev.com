Just wanted to give you guys something back.

Here's LocalizationTester - an app with which you can test your localizations of your apps one by one, without having to change system language or moving .lproj folders around. It's freeware, but I greatly appreciate donations :D

Here's the homepage: http://eternalstorms.at/page37/page40/page40.html
Screencast is also available.

Take care, everybody!

Isn't it the same as Miniglot (or using -AppleLanguages '(my_language_code)')? -- EmanueleVulcano aka millenomi

There are always thousands of ways to do some things. This is the thousand and first :D But I think it's more comfortable than other solutions.
