I just figured out a problem with an app that was freezing because mutiple threads were waiting on the same lock. I have a GUI that draws a bunch of icons in a separate thread. This wasn't a problem when I wasn't drawing that many icons while the display was being refreshed, but every now and then the app would hang. After sampling the app when it was in a frozen state, I noticed the problem was multiple NSImages trying to draw at the same time. 

Apple's documentation says that NSImage is thread safe, so I was kind of caught off guard. 

Here's some of the links that helped me solve my problem.

Basically, to lockFocus on an NSImage in a separate thread safely, just ask the image to use a separate cache to do its drawing.     [theImage setCachedSeparately:YES];
