I'd like to do a tabbed window with a light blue background, instead of the standard background or brushed metal.

Is there a way to do this?

----

    
NSWindow *myWindow = ...;
NSColor *myLightBlueColor = ...;
[myWindow setBackgroundColor: myLightBlueColor];

Ah, thanks.

Do you know how to use my own graphics for the tabs, and changing the alternating colors for tables?

You'll basically have to subclass the existing control classes and override their drawing methods. However, this is a bad idea in most cases. Users expect Mac apps to look like Mac apps, not some crazy blue thingy where every control is different. That's reserved for MicrosoftOffice.

Well, Disco's more grey than blue. :P -JonathanGrynspan
