Thomas Castiglione is a programmer.

Things he has worked on which are finished enough to put here:


* General/FocusLayer - a utility that dims the screen except for the active/frontmost window.
* kpdecode - Kernel panic decoding tool
* General/BSTrampoline - a General/TrampolineObject

Recently, I haven't been doing much hobbyist stuff, as I've had a more work than usual.
