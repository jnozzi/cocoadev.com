I'm a Cocoa enthusiast, although I'm usually not able to spend as much time with it as I'd like at the moment. I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at Brigham Young University, heading to work at Apple after graduation.

I currently reside in Provo, Utah, USA, and am a founding member of the BYU Cocoaheads chapter: http://cocoaheads.byu.edu
