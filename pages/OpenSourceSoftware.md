OpenSourceSoftware is software whose source code is made publicly available. It has sparked quite a few debates of late, but probably, the most balanced view is that it has its place, just like closed source software does.

See http://www.opensource.org, http://sourceforge.net (SourceForge) and http://www.osdn.org

Major open source applications: Apache (web server), Linux (kernel), FreeBSD (OS), MySQL (database), PHP (web scriping language), PostgreSQL (database), Emacs (editor), Mozilla (web browser), Perl (programming language: PerlLang), Darwin (OS), gcc (C/C++/ObjectiveC compiler)

Not to be confused with FreeSoftware. In terms of licensing and conditions, OpenSourceSoftware is a superset of FreeSoftware (all FreeSoftware is also OpenSourceSoftware, but not the other way around), though they are philosophically very different. (See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html for information on the differences, legal and philosophical.)

*After reading the GNU blurb I am confused -- I thought FreeSoftware meant it was gratis, whereas OpenSource means the source accompany the program (but it's not necessarily gratis).*

Another good resource for information is: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
It provides a list and a brief summary of all OpenSource licenses.  Before you release OpenSource code, I'd strongly suggest looking through the list to find the one which best suits your needs --OwenAnderson

That is a list of FreeSoftware licenses, not OpenSource. There are differences between the two, though basically all FreeSoftware licenses also comply with the OpenSource Definition.  The Open Source Initiative maintains a list of licenses which they have approved as OpenSource-compliant: http://opensource.org/licenses/ -- AdamAtlas

The term describes code that is open. I won't go into discussing the differences between free source, open source etc. Feel free.
