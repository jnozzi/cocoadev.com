So, anyone got this book yet?  Any good?

It doesn't do a whole lot. You're better off learning OpenGL or SDL, and putting those within Cocoa. The "game" that you would build from this book is very basic. Even Frogger has more complexity, and would be more interesting to learn how to build. I reviewed this for a blog entry, and I was being nice to the author then, but I'm going to say what I've found upon further inspection -- it's crap: not clear, not useful, and doesn't cover the more important stuff, merely skimming over the topics that it does cover, and not covering the parts that should have gotten most of the attention. -- JasonTerhorst
