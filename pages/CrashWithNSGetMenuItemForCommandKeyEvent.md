Two users have sent me identical crash logs, they look like this:
    
Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)

Both users cannot reproduce 100%, and one says the problem is now gone. I really have no idea what's wrong, so if anyone has the slightest clue of what might be the problem here, your help would be much appreciated!

I do gather from the crash log that it has to do with the system going through the menus to match a key event with the key equivalents stored for each menu item. But what could be wrong with the menus to make it crash?

I do set myself up as delegate for one menu and supply a submenu on request. The code to construct the menu is rather simple and I do provide either a key (as a string) or the empty string as key equivalent (not nil).

----

Can you post code? How are you supplying the submenu (i.e. are you retaining it or is it autoreleased?)

----

I can post code, but I'm not sure which. The code that builds the menu is trivial and I do not create the menu, the system already has a menu created when it calls the menu item delegate, and I just use:     addItemWithTitle:action:keyEquivalent: to fill it. I do add submenus for some of my items, these are auto released.

I'd hoped that someone would recognize the stack dump -- maybe a bug with OS X and menu delegates or similar? As said, this problem is randomly experienced by two users out of probably thousands.

*Later: I'm writing this off as a framework bug. What seems to be the problem is, that the system will use the sub menus from the menu controlled by the delegate *after* asking the delegate to update the menu (so the system will use un-retained menu items). If I retain+autorelease each item of the menu before I re-populate it, the crash seems to disappear.*

----

Well, coding like that is just good practice... Let this be a lesson to you ;)

*WHAT? I hope you're kidding. Should I also start to go through each item in an array and retain+autorelease before I dispose the array?*

----

Congratulations on catching it!  Sounds like one of the harder bugs.
