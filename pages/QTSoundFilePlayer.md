Kurt Revis's QTSoundFilePlayer is awesome :)  CoreAudio can be incredibly difficult to use, including the fact that there is no obvious way to feed it a sound file from disk. QTSoundFilePlayer utilizes QuickTime to convert any sound file into the data stream CoreAudio uses and allows nearly fully control over the sound playback.  I'm using it in Adium ( http://www.adiumx.com ) to allow us to manage sound volume and, via a small change to QTSoundFilePlayer, output device.  NSSound offers neither of these possibilities; QuickTime allows sound control but has tons of overhead and takes a lot of CPU while playing.

QTSoundFilePlayer is available in his PlayBufferedSoundFile sample program ( http://www.snoize.com/ ).
