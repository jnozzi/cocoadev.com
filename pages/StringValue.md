I have a question about stringValue.  What I want to do is take a username and password from an General/NSTextField and an General/NSSecureTextField in a Preferences Panel.  I want the user to enter in their credentials into the panel and allow that user to log into the system.  My problem is getting the actual strings/values the user enters in those fields for later use (i.e. logging in).  Here's the code I've messed around with so far:
    
- (General/IBAction)getEmail:(id)sender;
{
       General/NSString *user_id = [user_id stringValue];

      General/NSLog("@E-mail Address %@", user_id); // print it to a log just for my reference right now
}


The same code above would be used for the password except "pword" would be substituted for "user_id" and the method would be getPassword instead.

I'm still a bit new to Cocoa and trying to learn it all and have searched the site but couldn't find anything that directly answers the question. Thanks for the help! -Ryan

It is certainly not a problem that is specific to the class General/NSString. The problem appears to be that you want that General/StringValue to persist outside the above method. If that is the case, you need to learn about Cocoa's General/MemoryManagement system. The     stringValue method returns an **autoreleased object**. To learn about just what that means, read about General/RetainingAndReleasing. But above all, start with General/CocoaIntroduction, which will give you a more orderly path to your destination.

---- Actually, he also has a problem in his code, as well. If you just copied and pasted it, you need to fix the General/NSLog line. Where you have **"@E-mail** should be @"E-mail. That should fix one problem, if the General/NSLog itself is what's not working.

----Mmhm. Good snag. And as such, that would be handled by my recent reclamation project, General/ParseError.

----Thanks for the help.  I'm still a little stuck but I'll keep working on it and ask if I get stuck or need more help.  The General/NSLog isn't the problem though, but thanks for the fix. -Ryan

I don't think this line is doing what you expect:
    
       General/NSString *user_id = [user_id stringValue];


That's creating a new local variable named     user_id (which is initialized as a pointer to garbage), sending it the message     stringValue (which will likely crash), and then changing the pointer to point to the return value.

Try using a different name for the local variable (like     userIDString), or renaming your     user_id outlet to something else (like     userIDField).
