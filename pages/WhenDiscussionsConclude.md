When a discussion concludes, there are several ways we can reintegrate the discussion into the General/CocoaDev site. 
* If you have asked a question and received insight, either from a response or through your own further efforts, make sure **all** the relevant information is on the page.
* If it is a somewhat esoteric but very involved discussion, retire it to General/RetiredDiscussions.
* If it is a piece of essential knowledge about an everyday situation or class, add it to the relevant pages, or create new ones and add them into the fabric of the site - old General/CocoaDev hands will be happy to help with this. (The process of taking a page and rewriting it to be short, comprehensible and integrated into the site is called *refactoring*.)
* If it is neither, orphan the page (remove all \\%\\%BEGINENTRY\\%\\% tags from the page).
* Above all, it is up to the originator of a question to refactor a page if he feels the information he gained would be very useful to others, but feel free to ask others to review what you have done and/or help you out.


After around a month or so, static conversations that have not been dealt with by their participants should be retired (especially pages with heavy discussion on), refactored (especially pages with easily-extracted but non-obvious information on) or orphaned (especially pages with question-and-answer sessions about a fairly specific set of circumstances) by anyone who feels like it.

**Be brave! Most information will never be needed again, and will only clutter the site if refactored.** Retiring should only be done for very involved conversations in which many clever ideas were brought up, because otherwise General/RetiredDiscussions will become a junkyard, not a gemstore. Orphaning simple question-and-answer pages is not a crime!
