Hi, I'm having trouble with my webView's downloadDelegate. This is probably because of my inexperience with delegates, but anyway -

I have the correct code in my General/DownloadController, using General/NSURLDownload - it compiles correctly. My only obstacle is getting the download's URL to the download controller. I'm using the downloadDelegate for this, and I currently have it hooked up to my General/DownloadController.

I'm confused here; What should I do?
