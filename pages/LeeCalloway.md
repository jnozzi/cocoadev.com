A zoologist by education.
A computer programmer first by hobby and now by trade.

I've always preferred Macs and have new enthusiasm in learning to program for them now that OS X and Cocoa are available. A research background in population genetics and some psychology research using basic neural networks gives me all the material I could possibly need to keep busy programming for quite some time.

Currently working as a C++ and MFC programmer for a small company that works on simulation applications.
