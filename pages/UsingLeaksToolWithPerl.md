You can use the leaks tools with perl to create terminal output that is easier to read (at least for me).

I am not a Cocoa or Perl expert, so I imagine there is a simpler and/or more elegant implementation of the following.  However, I thought I would share it as it is has been very useful for me.

I use a debug build with following environment variables set:

    
General/MallocStackLogging 1
General/MallocScribble 1
General/MallocGuardEdges 1
General/MallocCheckHeapStart 1
General/MallocCheckHeapEach 10000
General/NSDebugEnabled YES
General/NSZombieEnabled YES
General/NSHangOnUncaughtException YES
