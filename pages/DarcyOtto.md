I'm Darcy Otto.  I run Wandering Mango ( http://www.wanderingmango.com ), and independent software developer in Los Angeles.  My current focus is software for research and education in formal logic.  I have two products: first, Turnstyle, which is a framework for doing first-order logic in Objective-C; second, Deductions, which is logic software that helps teach natural deduction.
