It looks like a simple problem, but I can't solve it. I need to set an image (a gradient) as window background. The problem is that in NSWindow method     setBackgroundColor: the image is tiled across the window. And when I try to draw image in window's content view     drawRect:, then the image is drawn everywhere except the toolbar.

Instead of drawing it in the window itself, either add a view at the back of the window and draw it in there or use the content view of the window. --LoganCollins

The Title Bar and Toolbar are seperate views, see:

The trick is basically to create a custom NSView subclass, then set is as the window's content view. You'll do this in Interface Builder in the outline view.

Here's a tutorial on Cocoa window backgrounds:
