Is there away to round integer values accessed using bindings to 0 decimal places?

----

Try using an NSNumberFormatter. Drag it off the Interface Builder palette (it looks like a text field with a green $ symbol above it) and drop it on whatever text field or table column you want to format. Then, configure it using the "Formatter" pane of the Inspector window (Command-9) when the field/text column is selected.

I dragged a NSNumberFormatter onto my NSTextField and configured it to display only whole numbers but now when I build and run I get the error

Does that mean you can't attach a NSNumberFormatter to a NSTextField or have I just done it wrong?

No, it means NSTextField is not key value coding-compliant for the key displayPatternValue1. ;-) Seriously, though, unbind from the NSTextField's displayPatternValue1 binding and bind to its VALUE to use a formatter.
