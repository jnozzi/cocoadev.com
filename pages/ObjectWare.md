ObjectWare is the idea of selling (well, licensing, which may or may not cost money) code in the form of objects. It's a pretty neat idea, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have taken off (possibly because of the market... many programmers seem to look askance on object collections with a kind of "Not Invented Here" mentality). But see topics on Unit Testing.

Some classic ObjectWare is the MiscKit, TheOmniGroup's frameworks, et cetera.
