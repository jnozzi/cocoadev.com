**Will Reiher** is trying to learn to program in cocoa. (and will now stop talking about himself in third person)


Okay, Really I am trying to learn C and then I will jump back into Objective-C!

As I said I am trying to learn to program, but I am fighting my seemingly endless amount of procrastination skills ;) I will be reading a lot here and at all the other cocoa dev sites, maybe then I will just absorb cocoa. I am learning quite a bit just from the Omni Dev Mailing list.

Anyways! I just want to say Great Work! to **General/StevenFrank** for all his great work on **Audion** and **Transmit**. I am always happy to Support great Mac Companies like General/PanicInc.

Oh yeah my email is wr11 at mac.com or something like that.
this is a highly intelligent note from your wise old friend General/FaeWiedenhoeft
