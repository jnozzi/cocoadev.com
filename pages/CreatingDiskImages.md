Does anyone know what the easiest way is to programatically create a Disk Image from a directory? The manual for hdiutil tells how to do it the old style, (using du, and hdiutil), but it says that some of it is now handled by -fs. If anyone could offer any insight, it would be greatly appreciated.

Hmm... Scrath that idea... I didn't catch the "programatically"

Programaticaly: Using a program :-)

----

When the hdiutil manpage says '-fs does some of this work now', it just means that this:
    
hdid -nomount folder.dmg
newfs_hfs -v myFolderImage /dev/rdisk1s2
hdiutil detach disk1

is now accomplished by passing     -fs HFS+ to hdiutil create.

----

Would it be possible  to use AppleScript to control Disk Copy, to create a disk image?

I don't know about doing it 'programmatically'. I do it with a shell script that I use as my final build phase, executed from my main project directory. I call it 'create_dmg' and it goes a little something like this:

    
#!/bin/sh

# invoke this script like: create_dmg image_name "Volume Name"
# it will produce image_name.dmg

# if a previous copy of the image exists, remove it
rm -f build/$1.dmg

# create the image. My software fits on a 5MB image
hdiutil create build/$1.dmg -size 05m -fs HFS+ -volname "$2"

# mount the image and store the device name into dev_handle
dev_handle=`hdid build/$1.dmg | grep Apple_HFS | perl -e '\$_=<>; /^\\/dev\\/(disk.)/; print \$1'`

# copy the software onto the disk
ditto -rsrcFork "build/Product" "/Volumes/$2/Product"

# unmount the volume
hdiutil detach $dev_handle

# compress the image
hdiutil convert build/$1.dmg -format UDZO -o build/$1.udzo.dmg

# remove the uncompressed image
rm -f build/$1.dmg

# move the compressed image to take its place
mv build/$1.udzo.dmg build/$1.dmg

Along the same lines, anybody got a convenient way, from a build script, to attach a license agreement to a disk image? I think it has something to do with resource forks, but I'm not really sure. I use DropDmg right now to attach big "THIS IS PRERELEASE SOFTWARE" warnings to all the beta stuff I release, but I'd rather do it as an automatic part of the build process.

You can use the DropDMG command-line tool from a build script.

Not sure how to do it from a script, but this page links to the UDIF SLA SDK: http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.html

Why oh why do you want to waste your users time by showing a license agreement that he won't read??? So that your software seems professional?

--

When your software corrupts the user's important files and the user sues you, you can point out that the user explicitly agreed that you were not responsible for any damage.

"Why oh why do you want to waste your users time by showing a license agreement that he won't read???"

When you throw 36-point bright-red type on the user's screen saying "THIS IS PRERELEASE SOFTWARE," he reads it.

(JeffHarrell)

Perhaps a bit off topic considering the title, but does it really make a legal difference?  Is showing a license agreement when you download the software better than simply putting the license agreement in a readme?  And finally: is this something developers should worry about?

--

License agreements aren't just for "don't sue us" purposes. I include a license agreement that covers the source code and where to get it.

This is a nice script - that allows licences:

Does anyone know how to change the volume name of a read/write disk image once it has been created? 

----

The same way you change the name of any volume. Mount the disk image, select the drive on your desktop, hit Enter. Unmount the image when you're done.

----

OK great, that can be AppleScripted and used with osascript, I don't know why the simple answer didn't come to me.  Still I  would prefer a command line method for changing the volume name, AppleScript is tedious.

----

Err, never mind I can use diskutil to change a volume name.
