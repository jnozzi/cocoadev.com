In Interface Builder, switch to the nib window.  Switch to the Classes tab and select your class from there. You can also select an instance in the Instances tab before switching to the Classes tab; the selected class will be the class of the selected instance.

Once your class is selected, go to the Attributes pane of the Inspector (cmd-1).  Click the "Outlets" tab and hit the "Add" button.  Now name your outlet.
