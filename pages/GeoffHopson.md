Started OO using Smalltalk in '89, then C++. Saw the light with NeXTSTEP in 1993, big advocate of that inside BT Martlesham until I got slapped about too much promoting it, so I quit in '96, went to Zurich, wrote a Customer Care system in NeXTSTEP, for a laugh one day put a WebObjects front end on it, and a new industry was born - online Customer Care! Joined a startup dot com in the US (in Boulder, CO) in '97 to exploit this, and still there with the company, although relocated back to the UK, to Maidenhead. Teleworking on a TiBook via DSL, no less!
