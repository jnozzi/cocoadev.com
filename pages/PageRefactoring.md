PageRefactoring is a term used to describe the process of moving content from one page in CocoaDev to its own page, or changing a page drastically to make it more useful. This housekeeping task serves a few purposes; including cleaning up individual pages and improving the way information is indexed by CocoaDev.

Times to refactor include:


* A conversation has started in an article which is interesting, but not critical to the conversation at hand.
* An article started as a conversation, but can be replaced with a more succinct explanation. Don't be afraid to make this kind of change, we have the History option now.
* New content has been added that doesn't fit cleanly in the format of the original article. The new content can be rearranged slightly to integrate into the existing text.


Times when not to refactor include:

* A conversation has started in an article which is essential to the topic at hand. Usually this is a temporary state where the guts of an article are shaping up around a topic (see second item in list above), but sometimes the conversation appears to be a more permanent part of the content.
* A conversation has started in an article which isn't interesting and/or isn't relevent to CocoaDev. The content should probably just be removed once it's clear it truly isn't important.
