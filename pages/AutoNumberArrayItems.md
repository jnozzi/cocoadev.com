I am looking at trying to have items in an array (specifically in CoreData and Bindings) to autonumerate when added, and always have the next number available. I want to do this for arranging them when they are printed, instead of just random or using a sorting solution. Also, I need this to be able to be changable by the user (so that he/she can change the order when they are printed however they choose. Is there an easy way to do this, or a better way that what I am describing? --LoganCollins
