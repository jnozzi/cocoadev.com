LListener, a class in the Metrowerks PowerPlant application framework, is a mixin class that implemented the Observer side of the Subject/Observer pattern.

A class that mixed in the LListener class could attach itself to an LBroadcaster (the Subject side of the Subject/Observer pattern) and would then receive messages when they were broadcast by that broadcaster
