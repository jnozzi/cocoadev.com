Chris Parker has had a long and varied computer career to the point where he's pretty much almost a platform agnostic most days.

After various Apple IIs and Macintoshes, he bought a NeXT slab in 1990 (it might have been '91) and fell completely in love with it, but alas left the land of net and found himself adrift with a Mac and (gasp!) a PC running Windows, which eventually became a PC running an early Slackware Linux. From there, graduate school beckoned and some cool research (http://www.dcr.rpi.edu/ ) got him back into Macintosh programming.

After a stint herding Suns, FreeBSD machines, and various SGI hardware for the department, he wound up playing with Mac OS X and is back with Objective-C and Cocoa, and pretty much loving every darn minute of it.
