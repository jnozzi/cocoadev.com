Has anyone got example code of using RendezVous in their cocoa apps? I know Apple includes picture share but it always crashes and is unstable- i don't want to base my code on that.

Thanks for you help

also - it seems that the PictureSharing example code has been updated - or so my ADC Dev News says (21 Feb 2003)
