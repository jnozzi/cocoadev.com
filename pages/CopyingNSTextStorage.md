How the heck do you do it?  NSTextStorage does not implement its own copy methods!  I tried using copy (came up with an NSAttributedString) and mutableCopy (came up with an NSMutableAttributedString), and even tried using a category to implement it, but to the stickiness of a malloc error (don't ask me how I got it, because I do not do C memory management).  How the blast can you do it (with layout managers and everything)?  Any help is appreciated. -RossDude

NSTextStorage is a subclass of NSMutableAttributedString. Unless I'm missing something, all you need to do is create a new text storage and use NSAttributedString's initWithAttributedString: method, passing the old NSTextStorage (since it's  an NSMutableAttributedString with additions).

And then call     replaceTextStorage: on your layout manager. Copying NSTextStorage doesn't really make sense, since all it adds to the string is links to other objects.

Agreed, but it's always best to answer the question anyway. ;-) Just in the off chance there might be a legit reason or need.
