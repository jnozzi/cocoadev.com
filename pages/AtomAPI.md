Does anyone have any experience using the Atom API with Cocoa? I want to convert one of my apps from the old XML-RPC spec to the new Atom API, but I can't seem to find ANY documentation for Cocoa implementation. I downloaded a framework from Daikini Software (http://www.daikini.com/source/atom.framework/), but it has no documentation and about fifteen classes full of stuff to go through. Has anyone used it before or can someone shed some light on the subject? Thanks. --LoganCollins
