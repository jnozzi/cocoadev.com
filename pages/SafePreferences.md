Apparently, Tiger introduces a new folder to the user's Library folder: Safe Preferences. 

A customer of mine is having problems where my program is crashing the first time it's launched.  My plist file is appearing in BOTH the ~/Library/Preferences and the ~/Library/Safe Preferences folders.  Does anyone know why?
