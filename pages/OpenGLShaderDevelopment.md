This may be just a little bit off-topic, but as OpenGL is well integrated with Cocoa, why not?

I've been looking into using OpenGL shaders, and I've tried to find a handy way to develop and test GLSL shaders quickly without having to build up my own app first. Neither of the two obvious options, OpenGLShaderBuilder and GLSLEditorSample, seem to be quite up to the task. OpenGLShaderBuilder lacks proper functionality to set the OpenGL state, while GLSLEditorSample has a fairly clunky interface and forces you to write both a vertex and a fragment shader, even if you only want a vertex shader.

So, are there any better tools around for this that I have not yet heard of? -- WAHa
