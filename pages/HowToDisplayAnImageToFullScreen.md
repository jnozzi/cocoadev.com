How to display an image into full screen mode?

----
Simple two-step process: 

1. Create an NSWindow which contains an NSImageView which contains your NSImage

2. Display the window full-screen (there's plenty of sample code here on how to do it).

Agreed - you can break this into two separate questions (the "BreakItDown" approach). First question is, "how do I achieve full-screen" and the second is, "how do I display an image" ... there is a plethora of information on both topics separately.
