Ok I've set up an General/NSForm programmatically and have it working with General/NSFormCells, but it would be VERY useful if I could have checkboxes and popups in my form as well.  Does anyone know how I could subclass General/NSFormCell or is it possible to subclass it to a non-textfield based cell?
