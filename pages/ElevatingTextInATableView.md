I'm attempting to copy the address book's GUI and improve on it, however I am having one small problem, I can't seem to get the text in the table to elevate 2px so that everything is centered.

I'd like to do this without making a custom cell.

Thanks.

It looks like you're returning an NSAttributedString for your objectValue method. There is a NSBaselineOffsetAttributeName which you can use to adjust the vertical positioning of your text.

Perfect, that was it.
