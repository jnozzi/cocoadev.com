(The name of this page should be L0AppleEventServices, with a zero.)

A class by EmanueleVulcano that, by posing as NSAppleEventManager, can extract additional information from Apple Events sent to the application. Currently provides a way to check whether a document was opened in the Spotlight search window and what query was entered by the user (to create Preview or Mail "Do you want to search all mailboxes for 'xxx'?"-style UI).

Licensed under a BSD-style license.

Example of use:

    

// in your main.m
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	[L0AppleEventServices activate]; // must be activated manually, see below.
	return NSApplicationMain(/* ... */);
}

/* ... */

// inside the app delegate
- (BOOL) application:(NSApplication*) theApplication openFile:(NSString*) filename {
	NSString* search = L0AppleEventServices sharedAppleEventManager] currentSpotlightSearch];
	if (search) {
		// invoked by the Spotlight search window
	} else {
		// invoked via regular means
	}
	/* open document code here ... */
}



*Note:* This class must be activated (via its     +activate method) *before* [[NSApplication register its private event handlers. As of 10.4.3, this happens in     -[NSApplication finishLaunching], but this is an implementation detail, not to be relied upon (i.e. other code may try to access the AppleEvent manager before NSApplication does). To be sure, you should activate it before starting any part of your application, in your main(). (*Note 2:* activation should not require an autorelease pool -- it doesn't in my tests -- but you might want to add one anyway around +activate as this behaviour depends on NSMutableDictionary's init method).
