<insert>Can anyone tell me why this example is allowed to ignore the "must be the same size" rule of poseAsClass: by adding an extra int to the definition? Incidentally, I reformatted the code to stop it adding a horizontal scrollbar on my screen. --General/KritTer </insert>

Have written it, I can't tell you that. It compiles... or did... maybe bit rot has set in, I'm not certain. As it is, I don't really have any use for it, so it's fallen by the proverbial wayside; thank you for the formatting, however (the horizontal scrollbar is bloody *evil*). -- General/RobRix

General/FDWeakReferencingObject is a nice little class which poses as General/NSObject to give all objects some lovely little General/WeakReferencing methods.

Class reference:

* +(void)setupWeakReferencing

This does absolutely nothing except insure that the runtime has sent the +initialize method to the class. Use this to allow you to use weak referencing everywhere. This is the only method you'll need to call directly. 
* -(id)weakRetain

Increments the weakRetainCount and retainCount.
* -(void)weakRelease

Decrements the weakRetainCount and retainCount.
* -(void)release

This is an extension of General/NSObject's -release method (that is, it calls General/NSObject's -release method within the implementation). All it adds is a short block of code to check whether or not the weakRetainCount and retainCount are the same, and if they are, it -releases and -weakReleases self till both counts are zero.
* -(unsigned int)weakRetainCount

Returns weakRetainCount, which is the number of weak retains that have been made.
* -(id)description

Returns a description of the instance. This varies from General/NSObject's version by putting the weakRetainCount in along with the class name.

// It does this by allocating and releasing a temporary
