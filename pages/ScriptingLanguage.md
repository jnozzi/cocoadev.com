A ScriptingLanguage is the counterpart of a compiled language. ScriptingLanguages are interpreted, whilst compiled languages are, well, compiled, turned into machine code.

Examples of ScriptingLanguages: PerlLang, PythonLang, RubyLang, PHPLang, JavaScript

Examples of CompiledLanguages: ObjC, JaVA, C/C++

(ignore the "Lang" part, it's just for the WordsJammedTogether syntax)

Oh, and don't forget about AppleScript....   :)

Java isn't compiled in quite the same sense that C is, though, since it's compiled to a byte code and then recompiled at execution time. Right?

-- FinlayDobbie


Java is compiled to binary code that a JavaVirtualMachine can run, in the same way that a C program is compiled to binary code that a PowerPC or Intel machine can run. The JavaVM then translates the Java instructions into PPC or x86 instructions (or system calls, dunno). Has anyone tried JavaVM assembler?

Has anyone tried JavaVM assembler?  Not worth the time.  I wouldn't want to write the Java assembly
code required for a simple loop as illustrated in this example from The Java Virtual Machine Specification
[http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/].  Most of us would get more out of learning more Cocoa.

The spin method simply spins around an empty for loop 100 times: 

    
void spin()
{ 
    int i; 

    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) { 
          ;                           // Loop body is empty 
    }
}


A compiler might compile spin to 

    
Method void spin() 

  0   iconst_0      // Push int constant 0
  1   istore_1      // Store into local variable 1 ( i=0)
  2   goto 8        // First time through don't increment 
  5   iinc 1 1      // Increment local variable 1 by 1 ( i++ )
  8   iload_1       // Push local variable 1 ( i)
  9   bipush 100    // Push int constant 100 
 11   if_icmplt 5   // Compare and loop if less than ( i<100 )
 14   return        // Return void when done

Generally, "scripting langauges" have a high instant-gratification factor, and frequently string-oriented (perl, tcl, python, etc).  You write your script, and it runs.  Compiled languages have a compilation and (many times) a linking phase.  Even though Java is interpreted by the JVM, it's considered to be a compiled langauge since it actually gets explicitly compiled, and doesn't have the light-weight, string-oriented flavor to it.

Jython - http://www.jython.org is very powerful.  It combines Python (interpreted) with Java's classes.

PyObjC might also be an option.
