I am the author of a program called Tryst ( http://www.trystx.com ) that allows people to watch movies together online.  I currently use VLC source for the video decoding as well as handling the multicast details.  I was wondering how difficult it would be to code this myself, and if anyone knew of a good place to start to look into this sort of thing.  I know this is a broad question, but I have never done very much low level video stuff and am thus a little confused as to where to begin.

Thank you,

Please don't program Video-Decoding yourself! Simply because video formats can contain so many errors, it's not even funny. So as a plea from your users: please don't do it!

Broadcasting on the other hand is something different. I'd look at the VLC-Sources and mailinglists for guidance... <g> -- General/MartinHaecker
