Does anyone know of a way to flash the screen without having the Universal Access option "Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs" turned on?  I would really like to flash the screen without playing a sound too.  So, turning on "Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs" and using NSBeep(); is out of the question.  The only thing I have found that even mentions flashing the screen is Technical Note N2102 http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2102.html it refers to the <OSServices/SystemSound.h> header, but that just looks like APIs for playing sounds there is nothing that indicates any of it would flash the screen.  Any ideas?

You could alter the screen's gamma or create a partially transparent white window over the whole screen.

Just do this:

    
FlashMenuBar(0);
FlashMenuBar(0);

Wow.  Perfect, F**'lashMenuBar(); is exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you.

Looks like the method is deprecated on Snow Leopard, alternatives?
