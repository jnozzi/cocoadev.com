Will this work if  'id' could be any obj-c class. -- JP

    
in .h

General/NSMutableDictionary *ivar_attributes;

in .m

- (void)setAttribute:(General/NSString *)key to:(id)value
{
    General/CFDictionarySetValue((General/CFMutableDictionaryRef)ivar_attributes, (const void *)key, (const void *)value);
}

It seems like [ivar_attributes setObject:value forKey:key]; would work fine, so I don't quite see the point of using General/CoreFoundation at all.  OTOH, I don't see any problem with what you're trying.  What's the catch? -- Bo

No catch, just theoretically. Unfortunatly I can't test it myself right now(Using a HP laptop) -- JP

General/CoreFoundation is apparently slightly faster than regular message-sends when you can use it, so hey. But yeah, looks like it should work. -- General/RobRix

Yeah, it avoids a message send, and probably a little wrapper code.  But I'd imagine the savings are pretty small.  It's best to measure and see if that's your problem before contorting a bunch of code.  (OTOH, it's always good to be versed in CF as well as cocoa techniques) ++General/MarkDalrymple

One should also be sure to run a proper speed test: message sends speed up after the first attempt, due to Apple's code doing some internal caching. -- General/KritTer
