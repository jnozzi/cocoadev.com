Is it possible to set it up so I can drag some text from my application and drop it into Mail.app and have it "file" it away as an email into a folder?  Or perhaps put the text into a new email?  I have googled for some kind of Mail.app API that would describe drag-and-drop actions but it only seems to involve AppleScript.

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks.

If it were possible, you'd have to write a Mail.app plugin. A better approach would probably be to allow your users to specify an email address to send whatever it is you want to drag & drop, and they can set up a filter in mail to route that wherever they want
