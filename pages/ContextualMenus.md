Try doing a setMenu: on the table columns data cell.  The data cell you 
see during drawing may be a temporary cell.  So, do something like:  
column2 dataCell] setMenu: menuForCellsInCol2].

Note that, by default, [[NSTableColumn only has one cell which is shared 
by all rows in the column.  If you need each context menu to have 
different items in it, you may need to make a subclass of NSTableColumn, 
override -dataCellForRow: , and either returns a distinct cell, or 
properly update the menu of the shared cell.
