Application Crashing 101: click the button in BombApp!

Included with the DeveloperTools.

If you use Panther and want to be a real jerk, try using BombApp to crash your programs, and then file bug reports from the dialog box that shows up when they crash. Yee-haw!

*For best effect, type your crash description IN ALL CAPS AND USE LOTS OF EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!!!!!!!*

Especially good idea if you shouldn't have a Panther beta anyway ...  :-P

Does anyone have any idea how BombApp works? **Sure, it crashes when you press the button (;**

    [NSApp release] *maybe? It just crashes. It's not a difficult trick to pull off ;)*

I have a friend who is completely obsessed with BombApp. Whenever he sees my computer, he always says "Hey, do the bomb thing!!"

Is it just me or has BombApp vanished?

*Yeah. I have it on an old partition, and it still works... or doesn't work, rather. Hmm... I wonder if it's crashing the way it was intended to crash now, or if it's just crashing?*
