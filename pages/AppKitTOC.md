AppKitTOC.html is the AppKit table of contents index file.

The online version is:

http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/ObjC_classic/index.html

Which, as you can see, is no longer named AppKitTOC at all. Of course, it has some very nice new cross-indexing bits that the current dev-tools version doesn't have.

The version on your hard drive is at:

    file:///System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/English.lproj/Documentation/Reference/ObjC_classic/AppKitTOC.html

The legend lives on!
