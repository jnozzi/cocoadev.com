Hi,

I'm creating an application that creates a graph using the SM2D Graphview framework. The function that adds a data point to this graph is called once every second. However I'm getting this message in the run log and  I don't know what to make of it. Can someone please tell me what could be causing it? The program seems to run smoothly with no glitches anywhere but I keep getting the message in the run log.

2005-09-01 19:30:43.818 ThresholdTrack[19682] *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x3ca460 of class NSCFString autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking

Any help is appreciated.

Anil.

"autorelease" can only be called inside an NSAutoreleasePool. If you're using code inside an NSThread, you need to initialize and maintain your own NSAutoreleasePool. Also, please PostYourCode
