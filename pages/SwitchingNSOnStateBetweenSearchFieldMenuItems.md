Hi!


I've been working on a browser, and recently when implementing a search menu I ran into trouble. In providing users with a choice of search engine to use, I need to changed the currently "selected" option in my General/NSSearchField. I tried doing this with the following code, but when I try it, there is no reaction from the menu items at all.


    
- (General/IBAction)setSearchEngine:(id)sender;
{
	General/NSUserDefaults *defaults;
	defaults = General/[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
	
	if (General/sender title] isEqualToString: @"Google"])
	{
		[defaults setInteger:1 forKey: @"searchEngine"];
		[yahooItem setState: [[NSOffState];
		[googleItem setState: General/NSOnState];
		
	} else if (General/sender title] isEqualToString: @"Yahoo"])
	{
		[defaults setInteger:2 forKey: @"searchEngine"];
		[googleItem setState: [[NSOffState];
		[yahooItem setState: General/NSOnState];
	
}}


What's wrong? I'm sure it's something blatantly obvious, but I just can't put my finger on it.

Are you sure that     sender is the object you're assuming it to be?

Hmm... It should be the menu item the user clicked on, but I suppose not. Any other way to tell what item was selected?

This is a common problem people have with General/NSSearchField. When you set up your General/NSSearchField, you set its menu either in IB or through code with setSearchMenuTemplate. Either way, General/NSSearchFieldCell takes that General/NSMenu as its menu template, not the actual General/NSMenu that is to be displayed.

So, assuming that googleItem and yahooItem are General/NSMenuItems in the menu template, changes made to them will have no effect on the General/NSSearchField because it's displaying a copy of that template made back when you last set it.

What you need to do is add General/theSearchField cell] setSearchMenuTemplate:searchMenu] at the end of your code to tell the [[NSSearchField to base its menu on your updated one.

There was a thread about this on the Cocoa-Dev mailing list here http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2006/7/19/167909

Thanks, that did the trick!
