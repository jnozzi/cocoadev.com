CarbonCore gathers together a number of lower-level Mac OS Toolbox managers. Some of these are deprecated but essential to porting to Carbon.

CarbonCore includes the old Device Manager, Date and Time Utilities, the Finder interface, Mixed Mode, CFM, the Thread Manager, the Collection Manager, the Script Manager, and more. Most of the Toolbox defines are in here.
