Hi all,
      This is Syphor here again :) Can anyone explain to me how the IRC PONG system works?? I know when ther server PINGs the client, the client is suppose to reply with a PONG. I have made a small basic cocoa app that connects to the specified irc server using small sockets and displays it in a NSTextView, but I can't figure out how to PONG the server... because after 30seconds it disconnects me from a ping timeout.

I tried something like this

    
[socket writeString:@"PONG :irc.dal.net"];


Though it doesn't work :(

Has anyone had any luck with this?

Forgive my rudeness, but perhaps these questions should be directed someplace else? This site is specifically for Cocoa programming questions, not specific questions such as this...

And I don't know the answer to your question, but good luck. Try the RFC's for IRC. IIRC I think the number is 1492, but you'll have to double-check.

This is cocoa programming.. I'm making a Cocoa IRC Client (Obj C)
