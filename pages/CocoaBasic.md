*is CocoaBasic still alive? it hasn't been updated in quite some time (April 20th, 2003 according to the link above)*

----

Apparently not. Mybe, there was not enough interest for a new Basic + IDE besides REALbasic. If interest is high enough to revitalize, we should send an e-mail to the developers. They might be willing to make it open source (e.g., GPL).

It has been made open source now: http://www.dsitri.de/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=203

The KBasic folks have released Objective-Basic which looks like it is a much richer basic implementation for OS X : http://www.objective-basic.com/index.html
