I am a new developer and working my way through Cocoa Programming with XCode (2.4.1).


When I am creating a new class in InterfaceBuilder and choose "create files for ... " in the Classes menu the are created under "Other Sources" in my Project Window.

Is there a way to create my files under Classes instead of under "other resources"?? I searched the documentation, the preferences and the internet but couldn't find the answer.

Can somebody help me out?

Thanx Tom

Just drag the files to the Classes group. All those folders are in Xcode are a fake directory structure that only Xcode knows about, it's stored in the project file. You can move things around from group to group and organize how you wish. --LoganCollins
