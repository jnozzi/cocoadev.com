I have spent the last nine months working on my first OS X application. Countless hours, frustration, elation and work. I can�t tell you how this feels. It feels like nothing I�ve ever felt before. I created something, from beginning to end, and now I get to share all of my hard work with you.

It is with great pride and immense pleasure that I announce the immediate availability of xPad Version 1.0: http://www.getxpad.com
