From the Mulle-Kybernetik site:

"The origins of the EDCommon und EDMessage frameworks date back to 1997 
and the original NeXT implementation of the OpenStep standard. Most of 
their components have been thoroughly tested and refined through years 
of use in OpenSource as well as in commercial projects. EDCommon also 
has full Apple-style reference documentation for all classes and other APIs."
