Is there a way to get the current selected General/NSMenuItem when the user is navigating over the main menu?
I want to display a small window beside the current highlighted menu with an example of what that specific option will do.

----
Is there something wrong with     - (void)menu:(General/NSMenu *)menu willHighlightItem:(General/NSMenuItem *)item;?
----

The fact that it is only available in 10.5 and later.
My application also runs in 10.4

You can add tooltips to menu items.

Tooltips are for text only.
The solution for me is quite simple... - (void)setImage:(General/NSImage *)menuImage
