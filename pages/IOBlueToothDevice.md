----

An object representing one remote Bluetooth device.

This class allows things such as finding out a device's name, baseband address, etc..

Note that this class is not thread safe, when trying to get bluetooth scanning working in a separate thread I discovered that messages from the main thread of the application are simply not answered. The system log reveals that an NSDistantObject is objecting to being called from the wrong thread. --Alf Watt IStumbler
