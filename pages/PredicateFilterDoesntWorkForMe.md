Hi,

I have a simple project, I want to change the predicate filter for an NSArrayController at run time. As part of my initial testing however, I tried just to hard code a simple filter     title == "foo" in my ArrayController in Interface Builder.

I have two ArrayControllers hooked up to the same managedObjectContext - one has this filter predicate, the other has no predicate applied. All the bindings were set up by dragging from XCode's modelling view. There is one entity, with one attibute, '    title'.

But the filter predicate appears to have no effect whatsoever, all records are returned. This is very baffling to me - new to predicates in Core Data, and they don't behave as I'd like them to :(

Here is the *very* simple project file: Connect to my iDisk public folder, username 'peterlaurens'.

Help much appreciated,

- Peter

Try entering a few test "Thing"s into your store, naming them randomly, then create one named "foo". Press the Fetch button. The non-foo Things should disappear, leaving only your foo Things. Newly-inserted objects appear to be excluded from the filter, which makes sense if you think about it. If you manually set your filter predicate and the user creates a new (non-matching) object, they'll just keep clicking that 'new' button because they don't see anything showing up. If you save this document and re-open it, only the foo objects are shown, since the non-foos aren't newly-inserted. Also, if you create a new Thing (and you have its initial title set to "New Thing"), then you edit its title to something not 'foo', it'll disappear as soon as you end the editing.

Thanks, (+ apologies for double posting to Cocoa dev list.)

So if I want an nsarraycontroller to be very strict about such things (never appear to breach the predicate) I should force a fetch after each insert?

*Try it and find out. :-) It's a good learning process. Using -fetch: just refreshes what the controller represents, so yes that would have the effect you're looking for.*

*Could you change the predicate?*
