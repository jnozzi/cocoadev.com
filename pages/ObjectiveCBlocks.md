Blocks are declared and typed as follows:

'return type' (^)('parameter types')

An example of a block that returns an int for two strings would be:

    
int (^)(NSString*, NSString*)


An example of a block that returns nothing from no arguments would be:

    
void (^)(void)


Blocks can also be declared as local variables in Objective-C code like so:

    
int main(int argc, string[] *argv)
{
  int(^x)(int input) = ^(int input){ return input * input; };

  int sixteen = x(4);
}

Ok but is it very different then callback function ?

Yes, blocks capture their parent function's scope, and can even access it after the parent function has returned. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)
