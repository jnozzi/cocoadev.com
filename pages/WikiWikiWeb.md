What the heck is a General/WikiWikiWeb?

A Wiki Wiki Web (or Wiki for short) is a unique way of sharing information on the web.

Unlike most information management systems, which are based around a central authority and moderators, Wiki content is open and editable by literally anyone who is capable of viewing the web page.  So, if you spot an erroneous bit of information, or a lively discussion, feel free to jump in and contribute!

The code for this Wiki is based on Ward Cunningham's original, with modifications by General/StevenFrank and General/KritTer.
