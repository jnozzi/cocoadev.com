Does anybody know of a royalty free gear icon (similar to what is used in the Finder etc) that is available?

Any talented artists out there who would like to contribute one? My design skills couldn't be worse ;-)

Some examples:

/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/Gear.icns
/System/Library/Components/CharacterPalette.component/Contents/SharedSupport/CharPaletteServer.app/Contents/Resources/Action.tiff

T<nowiki/>hinkMac has one for $3 USD http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/aquaicons/reflective_aqua.html - Support your fellow Mac graphic artists! :-)

Thanks for that. Thinking about it a bit more I'm thinking what I really need is just a piece of simple gear artwork which I can combine with my existing button designs.

I'll keep looking.
