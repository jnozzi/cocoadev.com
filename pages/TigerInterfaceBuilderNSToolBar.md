Before its release a number of websites had discussions (and the odd screenshot) of new features that Tiger would have...I seem to rember one site with a screenshot of the new General/InterfaceBuilder with an General/NSToolBar palette. Was this available during Beta? (and has since been removed), is it available in the release (and I'm too blind to see it) or am I just going mad?

If your talking about the palette panel having a toolbar item with an image that looks like a window with a toolbar across the top, that is the default palette image. The screenshot could have been with a new apple palette that just didn't have an image yet, or maybe someone's custom palette.
