Drawing in the system menu bar.


I'm trying to get the System Menu Bar View and then draw in it... 

Right now I know how to get the mainMenu of my App, but not how to get the Systems Menu Bar and then the View it has so I can draw in it.  Any help would be appreciated.

The system menu bar does not belong to you. There is no public mechanism to modify it. Additionally, to do this would be a gross violation of the HIG and very terrible design. Why do you feel you need to do this (ie, what are you trying to accomplish)?

I've tidied up your wiki formatting. Theres a page about it at TextFormattingRules.
