Tiger includes support for AccessControlLists (ACL) which adds new complexity to file security. 

Note: you have to turn it on first using the command line tool "fsaclctl"

A small application with sample cocoa code is now available from:
http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rpointon/osx/acl.html

It demonstrates simply how to read the acl info for a file, as I know of no cocoa/carbon API yet (though apparently Mac OS X server workgroup manager has a few extra preference panes to get and set this info).
