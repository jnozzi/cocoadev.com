I'm looking for a capable freelance Cocoa developer to assist me in completing a project. Any interested parties, please submit your contact information. Thanks!
I'm not really understanding the basis for this Wiki site, so I'm hoping I posted this in the right place - in the right manner.

*For one, it might be a good idea to post an e-mail address so that people can get in touch privately rather than publicly... as to whether such is well-suited for this website, that's gonna be up for discussion. I don't mind, but this isn't my site; it's everyone's. -- RobRix*

*I would prefer a FreelanceCocoaDevelopers page so more of these don't pop up. Make it so we can add/remove ourselves from our CocoaDevUsers pages and stick a link to it on the front page. /thinking out loud*

Also, you may want to note the geographic location as a paid collaboration may be difficult to do legitimately across certain borders ...

*What kind of application is it?*

I second Rob's idea of posting an email address

*I'd avoid posting any email address that isn't already getting hundreds of spams a day.  Maybe a URL to a contact page.  Or better yet, try posting to Craigslist and the cocoa-dev mailing lists.*

I'll post to further indicate that there *is* interest in the community regarding freelance cocoa development... so, post some info and you'll get a lot of hits.

Could always write it in a odd formatted way... ie. someone at somewhere dot com
