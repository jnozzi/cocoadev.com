Do you regularly write UnitTest**'s when programming in Cocoa?

    
What is a unit test?  (0) 
I don't know how      (4) ++++
I have tried but...   (8) ++++++++
I don't like it       (4) ++++
I do unit tests      (13) +++++++++++++
I intend to start     (1) +


You get only one (1) point to add where it fits best. Add your point and add one + char in the graph.

*Wouldn't "I have tried it butï¿½" be the same as either "I don't know how" or "I don't like it"?*  Not necessarily.  I could be that "I know how, I like it, but circumstances | employeer make it impractical"

For those of you who do not know, a UnitTest is used to automatically test your code and is usually written **before** the code to drive developement. For more information see: UnitTesting, UnitTest, http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTest

Also see ObjCUnit, OCUnit, TestKit, UnitKit

Also note that Apple used Unit Testing during development of Core Data:

This contrasts with Will Shipley's aversion to the practice:
