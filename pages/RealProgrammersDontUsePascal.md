A standard slight against Pascal programmers.

ObjectPascal (or assembly) was the original programming language for Macintosh applications in 1984/1985.  LightSpeedC (later ThinkC) changed that for many Mac programmers.

What is the easiest way to view ps in Mac OS X?

I use TeXShop or GhostScript (see PostScript page for more information).  Or, you can
convert it using the method described on the page you found.

OK I figured it out. Here's a link to those that don't know how to convert ps to pdf  -> http://support.stat.ucla.edu/view.php?supportid=29
