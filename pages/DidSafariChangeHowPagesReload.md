Has anyone else noticed that after you save a change that Safari doesn't automatically reload the page. I have to manually click on the reload button to see my changes. Is anyone else having this problem? --zootbobbalu

I meant to say has anyone noticed this after updating to v1.0. All of the betas didn't have this problem. --zootbobbalu

And I did mean v1.0.

Has anyone sent Apple a bug report?

What was this feature? Safari watched the timestamps on local files and automatically reloaded if the file was updated?

I ain't having this problem on my comp (2)
