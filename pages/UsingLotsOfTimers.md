Is this going to get me into trouble?

    
 - (void)textDidChange:(NSNotification *)aNotification
 {
   [super textDidChange:aNotification];
   if ([completeTimer isValid])
   {
     [completeTimer setFireDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:.5]];
   }
   else
   {
     [completeTimer release];
     completeTimer = General/NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:.5
                                                       target:self
                                                     selector:@selector(complete:)
                                                     userInfo:nil
                                                      repeats:NO] retain];
   }
 }


What I'm worried about is all the timers that get inserted into the run loop.  They get invalidated, but I don't really know what that means.  Are they really gone?  Are they polluting my run loop in some way?

Thanks,

I'd still like to know about the timers, but the proper solution to my problem seems to be General/DelayedMessaging: http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.14/14.12/DelayedMessaging/.

Invalidating a timer is supposed to remove it from the run-loop.

----

Is it? That's what I'm not sure about.

From http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTimer_Class/Reference/NSTimer.html :

"There is no method that removes the association of a timer from an General/NSRunLoop, send the timer the invalidate message instead. invalidate disables the timer, so it no longer affects the General/NSRunLoop."

on the other hand..

    - (void)invalidate
 
Stops the receiver from ever firing again and removes it from any run loops. This is the only way to remove a timer from an General/NSRunLoop."

The first sounds like it's still there, it just can't affect anything.  The second explicitly says it's gone.  Well, I guess you're probably right.

Yes, a better thing to do is

    
 [self performSelector:@selector(complete:) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.5];


so you don't have to mess around with a timer. You can get into trouble with this though if you call this too frequently -- say more frequently than 0.5 seconds. You'll end up calling your selector once for every call to performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: even if you'd rather they coalesce. So I usually do something like this:

    
 General/self class] cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(complete:) object:nil];
 [self performSelector:@selector(complete:) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.5];


You can do the same thing with a timer:

    
 NSTimer *mDelayTimer;
 
 - (void)destroyDelayTimer
 {
   [mDelayTimer invalidate];
   [mDelayTimer release];
   mDelayTimer = nil;
 }
 
 - (void)textDidChange:(NSNotification *)aNotification
 {
   [super textDidChange:aNotification];
   
   [self destroyDelayTimer];
   mDelayTimer = [[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.5
                                                   target:self
                                                 selector:@selector(complete:)
                                                 userInfo:nil
                                                  repeats:NO] retain];
 }
 
 - (void)complete:(NSTimer *)timer
 {
   [self destroyDelayTimer];
   
   // ...
 }
 
 - (void)dealloc
 {
   [self destroyDelayTimer];
   
   [super dealloc];
 }


See? performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: is easier.

But I don't get all the fuss. It's very probable that performSelector: withObject: afterDelay: itself uses a timer. And if you look at the first code snipped on this page, then if the timer hasn't fired, its reused, and delayed a little. Which IMHO is the best and most efficient solution to this problem. General/SubEthaEdit uses this mechanism in the delayed mode of the Live-Web-Preview and it caused no problems.
