hi, I'm SimonAndreasMenke (aka SAM aka luinithil) i've made my first FileMakerPro 'application' when i was 6 years old on a very old (still working) SE. after that i made some levels (in ClarisWorks) for a game called 'Avara', after that i started with RealBasic (i was 12 at that time, RealBasic is sooo easy but sooo slow). and now I'm writing cocoa applications that communicate with web-sites using SOAP, XML-RPC and AMF(Flash-Remoting). Currently I'm working on a PHP Framework for easy XML-RPC, SOAP service administration...
