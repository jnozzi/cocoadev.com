Franz Inc. [http://www.franz.com/] has been developing Allegro Common Lisp for many years.  A trial version is
available  http://www.franz.com/downloads/

Allegro Common Lisp, CLisp, ECLS and MCL have no Cocoa interface, so there is no point listing them here. The only Lisp environments with Cocoa interfaces are LispWorks (commercial) and  OpenMCL (free) --- at the present time. (Ah, okay. Cool. We'll leave it here, so we can fill in more information later. ;-) )

See Also:  LispWorks, OpenMCL
