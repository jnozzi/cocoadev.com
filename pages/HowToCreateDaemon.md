I tried it. But it crashes.
I have tried to launch the daemon at the system start. I created the plist file and placed it in  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.

It gives the following execption. 

Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)
Codes:      KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE (0x0002) at 0x00000000

Did I went wrong ....

It means at some point you dereferenced a null pointer. That immediately caused the crash.
