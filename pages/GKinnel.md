Hobby Macintosh programmer since Lightspeed Pascal days. Never really managed to produce anything all that useful, but I've moved from Pascal to C to ObjectiveC, pouring money down the drain all the while. Considering toying with Java *(But I came to my senses and abandoned that idea)*. I actually have Perl cgi code in production, which is a scary thought.

I've started a new little project: reading tab-delimited files into an NSTableView. As a low-level hobbyist, it's a little tricky getting started, but after stealing a bunch of code, I've got it working.

Again, the supply of round tuits is low, so that little project is not moving forward. Seems like a recurring theme.
