We have seen examples of Core Animation based software that does nice animation with hundreds of NSViews.
It would seem like using NSViews is not considered that expensive anymore.

Should we start to abandon the use of NSCell subclasses or custom NSObject derived representation classes that we now use to do custom drawing in our custom views?  I'm talking about a case where the custom view draws arbitrary number of objects at arbitrary locations.

If so, we could just represent all things with NSView subclasses and get the possibility to do nice animations for "free".

The real answer to this is still under NDA, I'm afraid.

You're probably never going to be in a position where it makes sense to represent each cell in an NSTableView with an NSCell. You can have dozens of columns and hundreds of thousands of rows. The current architecture makes it fast, and "hundreds of NSViews" is not enough, not by several orders of magnitude.

In any case, this has nothing to do with CoreAnimation. Obviously the NSView machinery has become faster than it was in 1993 simply by virtue of hardware improvements, and we can handle a lot more of them than we did, but NSCell still makes sense in situations like NSTableView.

Ouch. It kinda sucks being a paying select ADC member and not being able to access all the latest information. Documentation for the latest pre-release build is quite lacking.

I think it has a lot to do with CoreAnimation.  If CoreAnimation only animates NSView objects, then it becomes tempting to consider switching from the other mechanisms to using NSViews. That is, at least for some cases - maybe NSTableView isn't one of them.

The question may be prompted by CoreAnimation, but the answer is unrelated. The simple answer to the question in the page's title is "no". Whether NSCell is obsolete or not, CoreAnimation is not what did it.

I don't know where the OP is seeing hundreds of NSView's in an animation... hundreds of layers perhaps?
