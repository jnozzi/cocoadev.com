Defined in General/WebCore, available as part of Darwin.

From the header file:

General/WebCoreBridge objects are used by General/WebCore to abstract away operations that need
to be implemented by library clients, for example General/WebKit. The objects are also
used in the opposite direction, for simple access to General/WebCore functions without dealing
directly with the KHTML C++ classes.
