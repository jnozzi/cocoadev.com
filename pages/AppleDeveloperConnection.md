AppleDeveloperConnection is AppleComputer's very own site about all things related to developing *anything* for Macs.

You can find example code, tutorials, documentation, and just about everything else. Unfortunately, lately there's been a lot of "Description Forthcoming" notes around.

Specifically of interest may be the OS X documentation page:

Also, make sure to become a free member, at the very least, of the ADC Member site:

http://connect.apple.com/

It has lots of software available for download as well as the WWDC sessions in streaming QT. I find these sessions very useful and entertaining. Right now (10/3/01), there are only a few sessions online, but they should be putting most of them online very soon.

If you have $500 to spare, Select membership is well worth it. You get OS seeds (No more scouring Carracho! And you actually have the *right* to be using them!) as well as monthly cd mailings, a copy of every Apple OS release delivered to your doorstep, occasional 'surprises', discounts on things like WebObjects, and general VIP treatment from Apple employees on mailing lists ;)

You can get just the monthly mailings for $200

Of course if you have $3500 to spare, go for a Premiere membership. And send me one of your HW discount keys!

And don't forget the Student membership for $99. If anyone wants extra info on this, just ask.

FWIW I don't think select is worth $500. You get very few OS seeds, since Apple tends to only make 1 major OS release a year that's about $100 or so, the monthly CDs only contain stuff available for free from their FTP site, and so on. You do get 2 technical support incidents, though, I think...
