Can anyone describe to me how to write a Spotlight importer for CoreData in a non-document based application? I have looked everywhere for a good explaination, but have come up empty-handed. Delicious Library, for example, creates fake files that are just xml plists for Spotlight to index and then links them to the respective object in its data store. I want to allow global searching of the items in my data store by Spotlight, but can't seem to find out how to start writing an importer. Any help is much appreciated. --LoganCollins

Would this help? Look for the Stickies section (ie, doc-based).
