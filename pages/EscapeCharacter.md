There is NSCarriageReturnCharacter, there is NSUpArrowFunctionKey but you won't find an according key for the Escape key on your keyboard.

But after some searching on Google I found out that it's 27. So if you want to catch the escape key being pressed in your view, do this:

    
- (void)keyDown:(NSEvent *)theEvent
{
    unichar key = theEvent charactersIgnoringModifiers] characterAtIndex:0];
    if (key == 27)
    {
        [[NSLog(@"Escape Key Pressed");
    }
}


Hope this helps. Tested it on my PPC and it worked like expected.

Or you can just use '\e'.

D'oh!

Depending why you are trying to detect the escape key, you are probably better off using NSResponder's cancelOperation: method

What would be the appropriate key for the Del key (Note: not the backspace key, but the del key) on the keyboard? NSDeleteCharacter doesn't work for me...

Try NSDeleteFunctionKey.
