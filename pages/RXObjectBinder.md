RXObjectBinder is a class and IB3 plugin to let you bind to properties of custom views without having to write IB3 plugins for them. Instead, just add an object binder to the nib/xib, connect it to its represented object, and bind away to the object binder�at runtime the bindings are connected to the represented object directly, so overhead is minimal.

I�ve found it to be absurdly useful, and I hope you do too.
