I'm writing a basic HTML editor, and I'm trying to have an action that shows a open sheet, and selects a image, and inserts its path in the TextView. How would that be done? Thanks in advance. : )

he don't need no stinkin' documentation when he has this site to write apps for him.

*Dear God. This is *not* hard stuff. Just do it one step at a line. FIND out about open sheets. FIND out about the text view. Until then, please, back off.*
