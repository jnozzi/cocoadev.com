Hello,

I installed General/UnitKit a long time ago for a small hobby project and I really liked it.  I've recently resumed my project and continues using General/UnitKit, but it seems that http://unitkit.org is unavailable and has been for some time.  I've been in tough with the General/UnitKit author earlier, but he hasn't responded to my e-mail.  Is General/UnitKit still actively maintained or has development stopped?

What do you guys use for unit testing?  I really like General/UnitKit 2.0's tight integration with Xcode and Growl.  Thanks.

It's not dead.  It's merely resting.

Indeed, I found it resting at <http://web.archive.org/web/20050317031046/http://unitkit.org/>.

...but the downloadable files are corrupt; won't open with hdiutil.
