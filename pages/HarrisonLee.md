I program on and off these days, seeing how I'm getting ready to go into college. (I'm taking music so I gotta focus practicing Tbone). Naturally, I am in love with cocoa and all of its features; I love a good challenge. Right now I am a music student attending college in Edmonton. The program is pretty preoccupying at the moment, but my two main projects progressed quite a bit over the summer before I stopped for the year. Most likely I will be getting back into it very soon.

Update 2008 - Unfortunately I have abandoned programming as music is getting busy. Feel free to delete this page
