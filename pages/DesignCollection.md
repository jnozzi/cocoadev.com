**Object Design:** *Collections*

----

A collection of data is an object that stores a variable number of other objects, allowing access to them as a group (enumerator methods) and singly (objectAt...: methods). Various different kinds of collection exist, to cover a range of needs; there are also different ways of implementing them, with differing efficiencies in memory use, retrieval time, insertion time, etc.
