I am sorry if this is the wrong location to post but I have just started using XCode and don't know where to get help.   
I opened a Java project and then tried to open two .java files.  Instead of opening the second on in a new window it just closed the open .java file and opened the new one in its place.  I have mostly been coding in C with cocoa and had no problem like this.  Now I can't even open two .c files at the same time.  I checked through the preferences but didn't see anything saying only one window could be open.  
I really need help.  Thanks so much.

Do you have the Grouped option set on the toolbar? Open a .java or whatever file and click Grouped at the end of the toolbar to set it to Ungrouped. Now they won't do that. --LoganCollins

Don't take this the wrong way, but you should consider reading the fine manual. There's a lot of good, important, and non-obvious information in the Xcode documentation, and being familiar with it will definitely improve your Xcode experience. For example:
file:///Developer/ADC%20Reference%20Library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/XcodeUserGuide20/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/ed_editor_window/chapter_19_section_2.html
