I'm trying to backport a package to Panther and further from Tiger. How can I find all the incompatibilities quickly? Attempt to compile? Oh, and by the way, I'm not on Tiger.

You may wish to discuss details of your "backport" problems in TigerAndPantherCrossDevProblems if setting the SDK level does not help you on your way. The principle is the same for pre-Panther systems. *Quickly*? There isn't a pushbutton for this, if that's what you mean. Well, sorta. There is a Mac OS X Deployment Target setting listed in your project settings inspector. Yes, attempt to compile. Engage common sense. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.
