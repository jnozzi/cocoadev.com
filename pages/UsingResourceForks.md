General/ResourceForks were common under Classic applications, but they were unsupported by any other platform than General/MacOS. I'd like to be able to modify General/ResourceForks and read data from them from Cocoa, and if possible the new .rsrc files which have the General/ResourceFork data in the General/DataFork.

Perhaps the easiest way to do this would be to create an Obj-C wrapper to the Carbon General/APIs? Anybody have any other ideas? Has someone else done it yet? Is there some class I've blatantly overlooked?

You can go ahead and make the resource fork calls in your Cocoa code. An General/ObjC wrapper sounds like a fine programming experiment, but personally I don't have much use for such a thing. I want to move away from this legacy data format ...

Here's some code that illustrates opening a data-fork resource file from Cocoa. Note the use of General/NSBundle and General/NSString. This code came from a screen saver module, so I look up the class from [self class]. You'll probably want to use the app's main bundle.

    
// open our resource fork, if it exists ...
path = General/[[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]] pathForResource:@"resources" ofType:@"rsrc"];
if (path) {
    General/FSRef fsRef;

    if (!General/FSPathMakeRef([path UTF8String], &fsRef, NULL)) {
        General/OSErr err;

        err = General/FSOpenResourceFile(&fsRef, 0, NULL, (SInt8)fsRdPerm, &resourceRef);
        if (err) {
            General/NSLog(@"can't load '%@': %d", path, err);
            // force _resourceRef of 0 to mean we didn't open the file.
            resourceRef = 0;
        }
    } else {
        General/NSLog(@"couldn't make General/FSRef for %@", path);
    }
} else {
    General/NSLog(@"couldn't find resources.rsrc");
}


Mind you you'll still have to use the normal resource calls to actually get data out of the file. That's where your General/ObjC wrapper will get interesting.

Oh, and once you have a nice Obj-C wrapper for resource forks, you might want to distribute the class in the General/MiscKit. See http://www.misckit.com. That's a great way (the best way?) to share this code with the Cocoa community.

Thanks for the hints, Mike. I might do some basic General/ResourceFork code this summer, when I have some free time. Is General/MiscKit under development any more? The last announcements seem to be from years ago, and does it even compile for OS X v10.0?

I posted the source to a class, General/GTResourceFork, that encapsulates much resource fork work and is, for the most part, thread-safe. http://www.ghosttiger.com/?p=117 I welcome suggestions and improvements in the blog comments, but please, no spiced ham. :) -General/JonathanGrynspan
