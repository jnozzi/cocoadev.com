11 Jan 2010. I cannot compile the maccode version of PSMTabBarControl with Xcode 3.2.1. It used to work in older versions of Xcode + IB. Which fork is the recommended one to contribute to? -- SimonStrandgaard

24 Jan 2010. Now I have tried several times making an ibplugin out of PSMTabBarControl, but without luck. I have managed to make it show tabs, but alas it crashes when dragging it around, some kind of observing keypath exception happens. I'm no expert in bindings, so now I'm pondering coding my own tabbar, so I can gain some more insight how ibplugins works, then eventually try again porting PSMTabBarControl.

There are forks of the project on Github:

* http://github.com/dparnell/psmtabbar/ [2010] - this is supposed to make it work with IB 3.0 but currently I'm having problems installing it.
* http://github.com/ciaran/psmtabbarcontrol [2008] - this one adds functionality to the original implementation.
* http://github.com/splicer/psmtabbarcontrol [2010] - A fork of robertjpayne's fork of the PSMTabBarControl project 
* http://github.com/nanoant/PSMTabBarControl [2010] - Fork of PSMTabBarControl updated to work with latest Xcode 3.2.x and a interface builder plugin for 3.2+ 
* https://github.com/dorianj/PSMTabBarControl [2011] - Fork of PSMTabBarControl updated to work with Xcode 4.

I've ported and updated a copy of PSMTabBarControl via maccode to work with Snow Leopard 10.6 and Interface Builder 3.0. I had to patch a small feature out of it due to it relying on Carbon Framework ( holding spacebar while dragging tabs skips animation ). The IBPlugin is rough but it works.

Overall it may have a few bugs especially related to the IBPlugin but it will actually work and compile on 10.6. It includes a rebuilt demo app as well.

If you find issues log them into the Ticket tracker and I'll update the project as needed. Or you can fix it and push your patches and I'll merge them appropriately.
