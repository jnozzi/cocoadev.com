This project builds a Carbon C++ application that uses .nib files for resources, uses Dwarf with dSYM files for debugging and also includes the necessary openFrameworks files. It is mandatory to place the main project at the same level the folder \"openFrameworks\" is, so it can include and find the files correctly.
