I noticed recently that the documentation ( particularly, the "Concepts" articles ) on developer.apple.com are more up to date than the docs shipped with the XCode cd when I bought panther. That's all well and good -- and I'm happy apple has active documentation.

What I'm wondering is, how can I download it? I poked around developer.apple.com and the best info I could find was this:

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/faq.html

... which implies that if have a paid developer membership I would get a dvd periodically with new docs on it (among other goodes I assume).

Does anybody know if I can just download a package or tarball? There's some stuff in the new docs which I needed last night, but couldn't get to since I don't have internet access at my GF's place or at the coffee shops I get a lot of my work done at.

Most if not all of the documentation is available as PDFs, you could download those. You can also sign up just for the CD/DVD Developer mailings, which cost $200/year as opposed to $500/year for a full Select membership.

*Eeek, that's still really expensive though.*

Not really. It's downright cheap when you consider the CD mailings also include every major OS release for the year.

If you're a student then you can get them for $99.

The mailings also include Dev Tools updates (at least my Select mailings do... I don't see why they wouldn't also be in the basic mailings package.) If you're trying to avoid downloading stuff, that's a huge benefit.

It would seem that there should be some sort of documentation selfupdate, which could use CVS or rsync to keep the documentation concurrent with the copy on developer.apple.com.
