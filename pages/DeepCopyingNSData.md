In my app, I have an array of NSData objects containing data (array of floats) that must not be changed.  I need copies of this that can be changed, so I used the copy method.  However to my surprise I found that the "bytes" pointer is exactly the same in the copy-ed object, and so changes to the bytes of the copied object obviously change the original. I can't imagine ever wanting this (otherwise I'd use a reference to the original object) so I implemented a category method on NSData overriding the NSCopying protocol, to actually copy:

    
- (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone
{
  return [self class] allocWithZone:zone] initWithBytes:[self bytes] length:[self length;
}


which solved my problem and I was happy.  Until my windows stopped coming up, and I (eventually) tracked it down to here.  When trying to load some nibs, the above line of code kills it with 
**
*** initialization method -initWithBytes:length:copy:freeWhenDone:bytesAreVM: cannot be sent to an abstract object of class NSCFData: Create a concrete instance! 
**

I tried to see where things went wrong:
    
- (id) copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone
{
	Class shouldBeNSDataClass = [self class];
	NSData* shouldBeAConcreteInstance = (NSData*)[shouldBeNSData allocWithZone:zone];
	return (id)[shouldBeAConcreteInstance initWithBytes:[self bytes] length:[self length]];
}

and shouldBeAConcreteInstance ""seems"" to indeed be a concrete instance, but I'm not sure how to be sure. 
So:  Is there a way to fix my copyWithZone to prevent this? Is there a better approach for my main goal (copy NSData with a distinct chunk of memory)?  
Thanks!

If you are going to be modifying the contents of an NSData then you must use NSMutableData. NSData is for immutable data *only*. You are not allowed to touch its contents. Since you can't change them, it can save a copy by not actually making a copy of the data but only by referring back to the old pointer. You'll find that if you use NSMutableData, the copy will be performed as expected.

Your confusion stems from not having understood the Cocoa     copy semantics.  Please read http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CocoaObjects/chapter_3_section_8.html and the last section of http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Tasks/ImplementCopy.html .  Key point: *Where the concept "immutable vs. mutable" applies to an object, NSCopying produces immutable copies whether the original is immutable or not.* --K

I also seem to have been confused about editing on this site.  Just as I finished writing it I ran into some documentation suggesting, as has since been pointed out, that I should look into NSMutableData more carefully. I removed the CocoaDiscussions header, and figured it wouldn't be seen until I'd had a chance to reconsider the question.  Guess not :)   Thanks for the help, I actually had one more question about why casting to mutable didn't work that Chap 3 Sec 8 cleared up.

I changed how I was using NSData objects and added a category method to get mutable copies
    
- (NSMutableData*)mutableCopy
{
	return [[NSMutableData alloc] initWithBytes:[self bytes] length:[self length]];
}

As for why removing CocoaDiscussions didn't work, see RecentChanges.

Your category is extremely odd, because there's already a     -mutableCopy method which does exactly what you want, so there's absolutely no reason to add your own. I would suggest that you spend a little more time reading the documentation before you jump in and start implementing categories on Cocoa classes.
