**PoseAsAspects** - 

The idea here is that you could call [ACPoser wrapAllMethodsOfClass: [MyClass class]], and get a nice little stack trace of all the methods being called in your class.  And this bit of code does appear to work very well for that purpose, especially if you haven't done anything with MyClass before that point.  Also, you could subclass ACPoser and override the before: and after: methods to perform some specific aspect functionality.  You can get an example of that here: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/igotimac/PoseAspect.zip

The implementation uses ClassPosing

But, there is a major problem with this Aspect that need to be worked out, but here's some code of something that does work for some cases.  It seems a major obstacle of this approach lies in that posing as a class only affects new instances of that class, not existing ones.  So, I really just need to figure out where a good place is to instantiate aspects on things that are allocated and used early on. something like: [ACPoser wrapAllMethodsOfClass: [NSObject class]]. but where does it belong? if I put it too early (like in initialize or load methods of ACPoser I get memory leaks or sigbus errors).

Here's ACPoser.h  Note, you'll also need ACMethodIterator
    

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>


@interface ACPoser : NSObject {

+(struct objc_method *)replace: (struct objc_method *) method with: (SEL) replacement;

+(struct objc_class *)createClassDefinition: (const char *) name 
    withSuper: (const char *) superclassName;

----
an Old problem:

Originally the idea of this type of Aspect was use the objc runtime's ability to let subclasses pose as their super class, to dynamically make subclasses of any class we'd like to create an aspect on, add the methods we're going to have as PointCuts, and then swap their IMPs with IMPs to replace methods (taking the right number of arguments) that just call the original method which we have reference to as _cmd on super.. There is a big problem with this approach.  I thought I could just do [super performSelector: _cmd];  But what I really need is a [self performSelectorOnSuper: _cmd]; method.  because clearly it doesn't matter whether I call  [super performSelector: _cmd]; or  [self performSelector: _cmd];.   Because performSelector is implemented in NSObject, not in my Aspect class or any other class involved here. Instead I have to do something like:

    

    struct objc_method *methodINeedToCallNow = class_getInstanceMethod([self superclass], _cmd);
    void (*test)(id, SEL);
    test = (void (*)(id, SEL))methodINeedToCallNow->method_imp;
    test(self, _cmd);



which is not only dependent on the number of arguments I pass, but also on the return type.  Although the objective-c runtime seems to handle all possible return types with only one of two methods objc_msgSend and objc_msgSendV (with super equivalents) so maybe I can use those..?

----

Would an NSInvocation help here? You could even wire up a HigherOrderMessaging trampoline so that     self performOnSuper] someMethod:arg] would work, probably.

----

http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/Classes/[[NSInvocation.html   NSInvocation is great, but it has no concept of invoking on super.  (just like [super performSelector: _cmd] ends up being exactly the same as doing [self performSelector: _cmd];)   This just boils down to one thing....  

**How do I call some variable selector on my superclass (when I too implement that selector) ?**

[invocation invokeWithTarget:super] doesn't work? Damn. Oh well. Looks like you might need to use the runtime super functions.

So I'm just not worrying about casting my functions to have a particular type, or checking that type.  I just look them up, call them and then hope everything works out.  Can anybody find an instance where the following code does not work?

    
    struct objc_method *methodINeedToCallNow = 
        class_getInstanceMethod([self superclass], _cmd);
    id (*test)(id, SEL, void*, void*, void*);
    test = methodINeedToCallNow->method_imp;

    void * toreturn = test(self, _cmd, a, b, c);
    [self after: _cmd];
    return toreturn;
