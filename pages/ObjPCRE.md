ObjPCRE ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/objpcre ) is a well documented PCRE wrapper written in 100% Objective-C/C (MIT License). It can easily be implemented into any Cocoa application.
It also has a great Mac OS X regular expression GUI application called QuRegExmm ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/quregexmm ). 
The SourceForge project page has Intel and PPC builds of the PCRE library.
