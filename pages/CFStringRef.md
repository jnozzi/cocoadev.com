Thanks to TollFreeBridging a CFStringRef is equivalent to an NSString*

    
// Casting a CFStringRef to an NSString object:
CFStringRef cfString;
NSString *nsString = (NSString*)cfString;


    
// Casting an NSString object pointer to a CFStringRef:
NSString *nsString;
CFStringRef cfString = (CFStringRef)nsString;


But don't forget to call CFRelease on CFStringRef**s created using CoreFoundation methods when you're done with it! eg. CFStringCreate(...)
An example is when converting PascalString's to NSString's, as only CoreFoundation methods exist to do so.
