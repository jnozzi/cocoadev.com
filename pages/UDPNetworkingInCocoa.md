Is there a way to start a UDP connection in Cocoa. I tried General/SmallSockets but I believe it is TCP/IP only.

I'm not aware of a UDP wrapper for Cocoa yet, but you can use BSD sockets from within Cocoa. Just make the necessary C calls and wrap them in Cocoa methods. If you don't know about programming with BSD sockets, read this. It's a great introduction and teaches you both TCP and UDP:

Good luck!

The General/CocoaAsyncSocket project contains an easy to use UDP sockets class:
