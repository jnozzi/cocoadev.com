FreeNode is the project formerly known as OpenProjects.  They host an IRC service (irc.freenode.net), and there is a mac programmer's channel #macdev.  Undernet (irc.undernet.org) also has a mac channel (#macintosh), where some IRCers hang out in.

Undernet also has #macusers, which has a fair number of regulars, but which doesn't often have dev stuff.
