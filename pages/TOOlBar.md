You can't use an General/NSToolbar for this.  You are probably best using either an General/NSView with a bunch of General/NSButtons or if you want/need more control a custom General/NSView containing some custom General/NSButtons.

There is an unsupported way to do this.  In General/NSWindow there is a hidden function General/[NSWindow _toolbarView] which allows you to get the General/NSToolbarView associated with the window.  You can then take that and set it's frame in order to reposition the toolbar anywhere in the window (making sure to repaint your window afterwards).

Since this is an unofficial API, I'd recommend doing a check to make sure that General/[NSWindow _toolbarView] actually exists before using it in your code.  However, we've happily been using it on Mac OS 10.3 and higher.
