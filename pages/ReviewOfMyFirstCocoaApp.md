I thought this might be a good clearinghouse for people to post requests for feedback on their apps.

Hopefully, good-hearted individuals will volunteer their efforts. And those that would prefer not to may remain silent.

Suggestion to those who add to the list: put a date alongside the topic title after your beginentry - endentry field to clue us in to when you first posted.

*...and title your entry so we can tell at a glance what your App is about*

[ Hint: You may get better feedback if you post your sources at the same time.]
