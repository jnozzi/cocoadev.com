I've discovered how to make SOAP calls with the General/WSMethodInvocationRef and related functions, but I cannot make a General/SOAPAction appear in the outgoing HTTP header. Does anyone know how to do this?

It seems like it ought to be     General/WSMethodInvocationSetProperty( 
    soapCall, 
    kWSSOAPMethodSOAPAction , 
    (General/CFTypeRef @"http://ws.cdyne.com/General/AdvancedCheckAddress" );

but there is no such constant as kWSSOAPMethodSOAPAction.

You can create a kWSHTTPExtraHeaders property for the invocation which is a General/CFDictionary of { key (General/CFString), val (General/CFString) } pairs. See:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Networking/Conceptual/General/WebServices/3_ref_folder/chapter_3_section_33.html
for details. The snippet below should be enough to get you going.
    
General/NSDictionary *headers = General/[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"urn:General/GoogleSearchAction" forKey:@"General/SOAPAction"];
/* your code to create the invocation and set its parameters - see General/WSMethodInvocationRef */
General/WSMethodInvocationSetProperty (rpcCall, (General/CFStringRef) kWSHTTPExtraHeaders, (General/CFTypeRef) headers);


The headers dictionary could also contain @"General/MyFunkyApp 1.0 (Macintosh; Mac OS X)" with key @"User-Agent" if you want fame in server logs :)

	params = nil;
	}

These examples are great and I've been able to use these as a model to call my .NET web services, so thanks to everyone for contributing. I need to take things a little further, now.

So far all the examples are sending parameters objects as strings. Can someone post a sample that sends an array of strings (or even better a structure of some sort that includes an array of strings) as one of the parameters? I've tried a few things but I'm failing miserably.

Thanks,
