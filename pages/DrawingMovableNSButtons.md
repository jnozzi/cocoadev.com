Hi.  I was wondering how to draw objects such as NSButtons in NSCustomViews so that the objects can be moved around freely by the user.  I also would like to know if there is a way to keep track of them all.

*You could look at SaileshAgrawal's DragMatrix class, or UliKusterer's UKDistributedView class, both of which could work for your purposes.*
