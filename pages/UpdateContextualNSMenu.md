I set up an General/NSMenu as a contextual menu for a General/NSTextView and fill it with items from a General/NSDictionary. If the items in the dictionary change I need to update/refresh the menu. Somehow I can't seem to remove all items from the menu before adding them again. Is there a way to 'release' the menu and call setMenu for the textView again?
