I have an NSTableView, two columns one with a NSString, the other with a NSImage. I need an action that changes the NSImage column, of a selected row from its original image to a new one.

Just change it in your data source, Josha

What do you mean?

You can react to the table view's selection changing (as described in the answer to your question of a few days ago) by changing the image you return for     - (id)tableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView objectValueForTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)aTableColumn row:(int)rowIndex

You'd learn a lot more about Cocoa by actually writing this application yourself, instead of asking everyone here to write it for you.
