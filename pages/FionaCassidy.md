Fiona Cassidy is an undergraduate at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, studying Computing Science. She's currently a beginner programmer, mostly using Ada 95, and has fallen utterly in love with Mac OS X (and the iBook) thanks to MattGemmell's ceaseless evangelism. She has thrown away her nasty Windows 2000 PC and is now getting stuck into ProjectBuilder.
