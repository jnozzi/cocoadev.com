Describe ForgiveMeStillANewb here.


simply trying to grasp this concept.

when i declare a BOOL variable as an instance variable, and then create an accessor method to change it, when i go to check that it was changed, it is NOT changed...

I.E.

@interface Creator : NSObject

{

    BOOL fileMade;

}


------------


@implementation Creator


-(BOOL)fileMade

{

    return fileMade;

}


-(void)setFileMade:(BOOL)result

{

    fileMade = result;

}


-(void)makeFile // assume this is invoked.

{

    [self setFileMade: YES];

}


---------
//in another class instance:

if ([creator fileMade] == YES)

  //do something.... but it never does.


do i need to do some type of retain on the fileMade to get it to work.... i have no idea what i'm doing.

----

I think we need more info. Show us more code, such as the call to     -makeFile, etc.

----

make file is actually called as a result of an IBAction, along with some other code.  I know the call works because the rest of the code in makeFile executes fine.

also, if i change the logic to

if ([creator fileMade] == NO
  
it will execute the code that follows.  Almost like the fileMade variable forgets that it gets set to YES.... is that possible??

Please see HowToUseThisSite. Pay particular attention to TextFormattingRules and the bits that talk about giving your pages a descriptive name. MailingListMode would also be a good read. Once you've done that, check out CommonProblem, and particularly the linked IBOutletNSViewIsNil page, which describes a similar problem.
