Hi everybody! I'm Billy Doyle, known as SphereCat1 around the web. (Unfortunately no numbers allowed in page names here, so...)
I got into Cocoa development recently and loved it so much I decided to start a company of sorts to write Mac software. You can find that at Unsquared.co. Our main product as of now is Vaypr, which hasn't been released yet but hopefully will be soon! It wouldn't have made it as far as it has without Cocoadev, that's for sure.
