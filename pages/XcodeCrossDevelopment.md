If I want my app to run on Jaguar, as well as Tiger, but use specific technologies only for Tiger users, should I build using the Tiger SDK or the Jaguar SDK? Basically, what's the best way to build an app that will run equally well on Jaguar, Panther, and Tiger?

If you don't need General/UniversalBinary compatibility build against the 10.3.9 SDK and use General/NSClassFromString for any Tiger-only classes. I suppose you could do the same thing for Jaguar, but it's been awhile since I thought about it. See General/UniversalBinariesAndJaguar

*This is *too vague* and there is no easy answer. This depends entirely on which 'specific technologies' you want to use. Some things can be easily done by just *not using those technologies* if a gestalt check says the version is too low. By not using them, I mean don't call code, don't include libraries, etc. Start with 'gestalt' - that's how you can easily get the OS version number. If you have a specific question pertaining to your specific design, post that instead. From there, we can create a page for how to make that specific technology 'version-safe' and use this page as a sign-post since - again - there is no easy answer (that covers even a majority of situations).*
