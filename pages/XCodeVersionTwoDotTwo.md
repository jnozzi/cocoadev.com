Release Notes: http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/update.html (still on Xcode 2.1)



New features / Updates


* Includes GCC 4.0.1.
* Improved distributed builds, particularly in the areas of scheduling and error handling, and     xcodebuild now supports distributed builds.
* Target contextual menus items -- control-click on a target to build, clean, build and run, or build and debug the selected target(s).
* GCC now supports building executables with debugging symbols from the PCH physically separated from the Mach-O binary files.
* The linker now supports only linking in those symbols essential to debug a binary.
* Now you can globally turn off General/ZeroLink via the Build -> Allow General/ZeroLink menu item. When not checked, General/ZeroLink is turned off, overriding any settings in the project or target.

Just out of curiosity, does anyone know what Apple's process for updating gcc is? That is, how much work does it take for them to do a new gcc release? I ask because I've recently run into a minor compiler bug that's apparently been around since gcc 4.0, and apparently has been fixed in 4.0.3 or so, and I was wondering why Apple's release didn't bring us up to 4.0.3. I'm assuming it has to do with work on the General/ObjC compiler or some such, but I'm not really sure. -- General/RobRix

Xcode was a universal binary starting with version 2.1, so this is nothing new *deleting off list*

Any delta updates available?? 2.2.1 has just been released, but it's only available as a FULL download from what I can see. Downloading 800MB+ for a 0.0.1 updated is..... ridiculous!
