My real name is Dag ï¿½gren. I code in C, Objective-C, C++, Perl, and various other languages. Some of my works are available at http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/.

I have created the following pieces of code available on General/CocoaDev:


*  A simple regex wrapper called General/CSRegex.
* An implementation of General/CoRoutine**'s for Cocoa called General/CSCoroutine.
* A function to General/ParseDSStoreFiles.
* A category to make General/NSDataHexDump**'s, for easier reading.
* A small tool to General/ListAllDeclaredTypeIdentifiers.
* A Perl script that uses the above program to parse an Info.plist and General/ExportTypeIdentifiers.
* A piece of code I claim to be the General/StupidestCocoaCodeEver.
