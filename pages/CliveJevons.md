I'm actually a seasoned C++ and Java professional, but got into Macs once OS X was released (I wanted an easy to use computer for my wife, and found that OS X actually really kicks arse, so decided to get one for myself and haven't looked back since :)) - and since I love learning new programming languages / APIs / environments, thought I'd take the plunge into Objective C / Cocoa rather than going the Java / Cocoa way, which probably would have been easier for me. I've found Objective C to be reasonably good to work with. I still prefer Java / C# over it, but that's probably just because of my background. Its not because of the strict typing in the former, because my all time favorite language is actually Python - so Objective C is actually closer to that. But I do prefer the syntax of Java / C# - if you find you want to add another method call to an already existing one, then you have to add a square brace at the beginning and end of the existing call - in Java / C# (/C / C++ / Python) you simply add a dot and the new method - less typing and jumping around in the code. I guess it would be less of an issue if there were Vi bindings for XCode - but I don't think we'll be seeing that any time soon :(

Aside from programming, my interests lie in music - Jazz and Metal in particular -, playing guitar (http://beyondredemption.net http://bludgeoned.net), dogs (we currently have 3 - a Labrador and two pugs), and lastly but most importantly my family - my wife Jo and my daughter Hannah.

Enough of the rambling already!
