I have created a custom palette which contains a customized slider which draws a different background. 
I have implemented both slider and slider cell. I can drag the control from the palette to application window.
But, when I double click the slider control in the IB, the slider control turns out to be normal NSSlider. 

setCellClass method does not work in palette. I think I have to implement the Editor for the control. 

Any solution.....
