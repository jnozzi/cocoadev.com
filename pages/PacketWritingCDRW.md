Is it possible to use the DiscBurning APIs to do packet-writing with the standard Apple CD-R drives?  Or does anyone know of an OSS package that will do this?  I found the XCDRoast on SourceForge, but it's beta for UNIX, so I figure it would be quite difficult to convert it to OSX.

This question has been lurking at the bottom of CocoaDiscussions for 16 months now (as of Dec 2005).

Now it doesn't lurk there any more.  At any rate, the OP seems to have moved on. For interested parties, there is now a link to a Panther-compatible version: http://www.xcdroast.org/xcdr098/xcdrosX.html

It seems to be an X11-oriented package, so perhaps not too relevant to Cocoa development.
