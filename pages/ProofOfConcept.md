All of this talk about BigO notation and premature optimization is getting away from the importance of proof of concept. The value in seeing an idea through to something functional is more important than worrying about the details of �if� the best approach was taken. A proof of concept will reveal design flaws more efficiently than any amount of design analysis. Get something working first and then optimize. Tangibles should not be pushed aside in favor of intellectual ponder. Stalemate can easily enter into an equation for pre-optimization. A heuristic approach requires trial and error. Science and experimentation are not polar opposites. Keep your eyes on the ball. I�m not surprised a large fraction of software projects never see the light of day. Squabble, Squabble, Squabble��.
