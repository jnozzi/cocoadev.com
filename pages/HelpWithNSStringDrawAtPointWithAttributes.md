Hello,

I am using the
    
[NSString drawAtPoint:withAttributes:] 

method to draw some text to a custom NSView. I want to make the font size smaller, say maybe 9 pt, rather than the default 12.0 pt.

I cannot find any good documentation on this method that shows how to do it. I think I might have to use
    
[NSFont fontWithName:size:]
,
 but really I'm not sure how to relate this to a dictionary - can't find any info on how dictionaries come in to play with this method.

----
In Xcode, File->Open Quickly, type     AppKit/NSAttributedString.h and read up.

I took a look at that file,thank you for the pointer. I did not find it too helpful, however. I will keep looking.

How hard did you look for doco?
