metaobject's general-purpose toolkit.  Compiles on Jaguar as well as on GNUstep for Linux and Windows.

This is where HOM was born (and named), as a packaging mechnaism for interfacing to an enumerator-based collection-filtering mechanism.  Also contains object-streams (with byte-streaming subclasses), object-caches for fast temporary object-allocation, accessor macros, coding macros, etc.
