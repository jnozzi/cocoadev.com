DTCPathView is an open source class that can be used freely by any Cocoa/Objective-C developers. It allows the programmer to easily add auto-completion of absolute path strings to any NSTextField.

DTCPathView requires Mac OS X v10.1 or greater. The class source also comes with an example project which requires Xcode.
