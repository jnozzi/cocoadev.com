The ultimate     Description forthcoming. These live in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks. Use them at your own risk, because Apple will feel free to pull the rug completely out from under your feet.

Private frameworks are a frequent topic on UndocumentedGoodness pages

If you use a PrivateFramework, such as CALCore, in your program, is that legal?  *Yes.* And second, if Apple removes that framework from OS, is it illegal to bundle it in your application? *Heck no! This isn't that different from distributing anything of Apple's, like say, OS 10.3.*

There's no obvious legal reason why you wouldn't be able to link to any library on a user's system. Distributing somebody else's software, however, is always illegal unless he gives you permission. Of course, I'm a coder, not a lawyer, Jim.
