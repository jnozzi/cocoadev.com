New Release: **General/UnfiledBaby** a plugin for Panther's Address Book, providing a new meta-group "unfiled", showing all users that have not been placed into any groups. See http://dirtoy.sourceforge.net/General/UnfiledBaby.html


I'm presently writing a General/MailBundle to extend Mail.app to do the following:
  
  * avoid redundant entries when doing 'add sender to address book'
  * adds 'add sender to group...' on command-shift-y
  * automatically generate rules for your mailboxes in the following forms: 
  
  * if sender is member of group (NAME) move to mailbox (NAME)
  * if subject contains "[NAME]" move to mailbox (NAME)
  * if subject contains "NAME:" move to mailbox (NAME)
   
    


This was pretty much inspired by the "god damn, I do this all the time" reaction and the realization that I could do something about it. 
This, along with my address book tool can be found at http://dirtoy.sourceforge.net
