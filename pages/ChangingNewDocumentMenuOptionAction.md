I want to change the action of the menu option "New Document" to call a method written by me. But I need my method to call the action assigned by Interface Builder and, after that, do other things. So I need to call the method "newDocument" of FirstResponder, but don't know how to get the first responder.

Thanks in Advance.

[NSApp sendAction:@selector(newDocument:) to:nil from:self];
