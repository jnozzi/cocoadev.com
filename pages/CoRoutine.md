Coroutines are a generalization of subroutines that allow multiple entry points and suspending and resuming of execution at certain locations. A coroutine can pass control to another coroutine, and when control is passed back to it, it will resume where it left off earlier. Coroutines are especially useful for performing certain kinds of tasks, such as cooperative tasks, iterators, infinite lists, and pipes.
