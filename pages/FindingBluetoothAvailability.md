Does anybody know how to find out if Bluetooth is available on the machine? I can't seem to find an IOBluetooth or IOKit call to search for it. Anybody have some hints?

As in

    
    if (IOBluetoothLocalDeviceAvailable()) {
        // do a bunch of bluetooth stuff ...
    }

It also makes sense to check whether the device is turned on:

    
- (BOOL)localDeviceIsPowered {
    BluetoothHCIPowerState powerState;
    IOBluetoothLocalDeviceGetPowerState(&powerState);
    if(powerState == kBluetoothHCIPowerStateOFF) return FALSE;
    return TRUE;
}
