Hello. I'm trying to create a custom view with various controls and an editable 'Title' text cell. The thing is, I don't want the text cell to be editable until it's double-clicked (like a cell in a table view). This is because I want the user to be able to click and drag the custom view around its superview by dragging any part of the view. In other words, if they click and drag in the title area, I don't want it to automatically focus and go into 'edit' mode. Where can I find information on this?
