I need to wake the computer from sleep at a certain time. So I downloaded the "wakein" code from Apple's developer site. This works fine on my General/PowerBook, but on an Intel iMac it doesn't work at all. Does this only work on PPC? Does anyone have any suggestions?
Thanks.

Just what I need! Thanks.
