A MacOS development framework that has been around since 1994.  It is written in C++ and was supplied with Metrowerks' CodeWarrior environment.  After CodeWarrior's discontinuation in 2005, Freescale released PowerPlant, PowerPlantX, and Constructor as OpenSourceSoftware.  They are available on sourceforge at http://open-powerplant.sourceforge.net/
