What would be the best way to retrieve the HTML source for a web page in a WebView?

Thanks, and merry Christmas.

The main frame of the web view is probably the best place to start.

    
- (NSData *)HTMLDataFromWebView:(WebView *)webView {

    WebFrame *mainFrame = [webView mainFrame];
    WebDataSource *dataSource = [mainFrame dataSource];
    NSURLRequest *initialRequest = [dataSource initialRequest];
    NSURL *url = [initialRequest URL];
    DOMDocument *doc = [mainFrame DOMDocument];

    return [dataSource data];

}


The DOMDocument is an object model of the web view's content. Check out DOMCore for more info. --zootbobbalu

Why exactly are you creating initialRequest, url, and doc in that example? And why are you returning an NSData object, when he most likely is going to want it as a string?  To anyone copying and pasting that code, it is a little over the top and has three unused variables.

    
- (NSString *)HTMLSourceFromWebView:(WebView *)webView {
    WebFrame *mainFrame = [webView mainFrame];
    WebDataSource *dataSource = [mainFrame dataSource];
    
    return dataSource representation] documentSource];
}

// or, more simply put as:

- ([[NSString *)HTMLSourceFromWebView:(WebView *)webView {
    return [[webView mainFrame] dataSource] representation] documentSource];
}

Thanks guys. Yeah, the string is what need the most.

I'm trying to give as much info as possible. Of course those variables are doing nothing. I intentionally put them there to enlighten the original poster to the basics of working with WebKit. --zootbobbalu

*Reformatted for clarity.*

**January 4, 2005** - The above example retrieves the original document contents. However, if you make the WebView editable and make changes, the above will not retrieve the changed text. The following example will:

    
- (NSString *)HTMLSourceFromWebView:(WebView *)webView
{
    return [[webView mainFrame] [[DOMDocument] documentElement] outerHTML];
}


*The above example uses DOMDocument, which was introduced in Tiger so your app's minimum requirements would become Tiger or above.  Just a note.*

How would you get the source from a URL or URL string directly without loading it in a WebView?
