Moved to BorderlessWindow under the topic TipsAndTricks. If you are having difficulties with a BorderlessWindow not covered on that page, add a description here. For some additional interesting discussion, see NSWindowDoesntShow, which deals with a transparent, shadowless, borderless window with no content, which will make it, well, invisible.
