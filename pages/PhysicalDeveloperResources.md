I would just like to make a note that funmac.com is willing to give free website hosting (via subdomains or via a .com) for any developer. This hosting includes your own area of the server (many gb's of space) and a free forum all set up free of charge (yes, lots of free's).

There are no catches to the deal.

Funmac notifies me that Adium and The Little App Factory are two developers already hosted there. Also hosted are 3 themeing groups, Max Rudberg, The Android Workshop and David's Corner.

As I said, there are no catches, they simply have excess bandwidth and excess space on the server and would like to assist any developers that might need these resources.

Feel free to contact the owner at jbanks @ ambitiouslemon.com

There are a couple things I can see in the fine print. You can't sell any products or services, and any donations (i.e. PayPal) must have a portion go back to AmbitiousLemon for the servers. Not a big deal, but worth noting.

*Um, The Little App Factory sells all of their products. How does that work out?*

The (charity) business model is not buried that deeply: "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who doesn't meet our standards."
Or maybe it's the "art gallery" business model. Whatever.
Too many "charities" exist not primarily to serve their clients, but to pay their staff. I don't really want to prejudge this one,
but there is some elitist writing on the wall.
