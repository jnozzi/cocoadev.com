I have been REALLY trying to learn bindings by following CoreData documentation and the sample code provided by Apple.

Last night I upgraded to Tiger 10.4.3 which notes some improvements to CoreData.

This morning CoreDataRecipes no longer works correctly.

To be sure I re-downloaded the sample code and sure 'nuf no longer works...
The Groups rule specification pop-up do not populate - specifically the operator values.

Anyone out there have any thoughts on this matter?
Where can we get details beyond:   
.....
The Core Data framework has been updated to improve relationship  
management issues, resolve issues with data migration, improve Undo  
and Redo commands, and improve insertion performance.
.....
I am having the same problems.  Any help would be wonderful!  I am trying to solve it myself at the moment.
