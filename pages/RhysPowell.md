Rhys Powell is a Sydney based high school student who's been programming for the Mac since he finally got the money to buy one in 2010, before that he was a Ruby developer and keen user of the Unity 3D game authoring toolkit. He still uses Ruby and is a keen user of the Sinatra web framework.

He is aiming to study CS at university (wish him luck) and maybe even one day start his own software shop.

His homepage is at http://frog.io/
