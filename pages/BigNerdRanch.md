BigNerdRanch is a set of people who teach Cocoa programming. They offer 5 day courses on Cocoa, and have two books. The first, "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X", is a book to teach Cocoa programming. See more at BookCocoaProgMacOSX. The second, "Advanced Mac OS X Programming", discusses more advanced topics. See BookCoreMacOSXAndUnix. Their website is http://www.bignerdranch.com.

So, has anyone here ever been to one of the 5 day classes?

I did.  I liked it so much I became an instructor :-)  I wrote a review over at MacEdition several months before I got involved with the BNR folks busin<nowiki/>ess-wise: http://macedition.com/feat/feat_bnr_20020424.php . The location has changed (now in the Atlanta area), but the facilities there are *very* nice.  If you want to get up to speed on Cocoa very quickly, The Big Nerd Ranch is a great way to do it. ++MarkDalrymple ( Edited by PietroGagliardi to escape spam filter with one of the words above )
