Metrowerks CodeWarrior for Macintosh was a popular IDE for Classic and Carbon development, with a project manager; text editor; Pascal, C, C++, Objective-C, and Java compilers and linkers; and debuggers.

CodeWarrior for Mac was discontinued in 2005, around the time of Apple's announced switch to Intel CPUs. The last release was CodeWarrior Pro 10.

CodeWarrior supported Objective-C and Cocoa development, but was never very popular amongst Cocoa developers.  It did not support newer language features like @synchronized and had no built in Cocoa documentation.  On the other hand, it's compiler and linker were significantly faster than Apple's development tools of the time.  CodeWarrior was never able to build UniversalBinaries.

As of this writing (early 2008), CodeWarrior Pro 10 continues to partly work on Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier.  For best results, the 10.3 or earlier SDK should be used, as later SDKs cause compiler errors with some headers.  Compiling and linking seem to work OK, but debugging does not.

Many Mac developers were big fans of CodeWarrior.  The Metrowerks sessions at WWDC and MacHack were well liked.
