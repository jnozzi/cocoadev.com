Has anyone here looked at or used a product called ActiveDeveloper from http://www.interactive-technology.com/

It looks like an interesting product and perhaps a good learning tool, although the docs appear somewhat confusing. Because installation is more involved than just drag & drop, I thought I would check to see if there are any opinions on it.

Well the site and graphics are horrifying and obnoxious ... other than that, looking at screenshots and other details, I fail to see what this has to offer a Cocoa developer over XCode. The millions of windows and the counterintuitive-looking controls and organization fail to impress. I'll stick with XCode Tools.

I certainly don't mean to sound overly-critical, but a good interface is quite necessary for effective software. Any computer-savvy eye can determine, at a glance, the usefulness and quality of an interface.The above sums up my views nicely; I took a look and determined it didn't look polished enough to suggest more care went into its core than into its facade.

*Response to this innocuous looking statement can be found in* UserInterfaceDesign.
