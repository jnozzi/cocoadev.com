Deusty Designs recently released the HTTP server they use to power their Mojo app.  It has:


*Built in support for bonjour broadcasting
*IPv4 and IPv6 support
*Asynchronous networking using standard Cocoa sockets/streams
*Digest access authentication
*TLS encryption support
*Extremely FAST and memory efficient
*Heavily commented code
*Very easily extensible


Best of all, it's released under a BSD style license, so it can actually be used by Indie Mac developers in commercial apps.

We need a good HTTPS/SSL example using this framework as the documentation on this subject is scarce at best.
