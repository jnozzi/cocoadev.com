I've worked with AppKit since late 1994. Nowadays, we don't get that many non-WebObjects projects, unfortunately, so if I program under Cocoa it's in my spare time.

I'm a fan of ExtremeProgramming and MalteTancred and I have put together the ObjcUnit testing framework.

I have wiki pages at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeterLindberg, http://oops.se/cgi-bin/wiki?PeterLindberg and I have a blog at http://tesugen.com.
