"THINK Reference" was a product sold by Symantec from '91 to '94. It contained all of the Macintosh API stored in a database that would autocomplete entries as you typed them in a search field, much like iTunes does today.

It was loved for its instant searching, hooks into development General/IDEs, and the annotated descriptions of common General/APIs, including examples and warnings.

Some Macintosh programmers still use it frequently, even though the database of General/APIs hasn't been updated since 1994.
