I managed to find a pre-compiled version of CURLHandle for both intels and ppcs, and I installed the framework into my /Library/Frameworks folder. I found the framework at this address:

http://www.bleepsoft.com/developers

1. I know this is probably a stupid question, but what dependencies does this framework have? Do I have to already have curl and libcurl installed?

2. I'm assuming that I need to install the CURLHandle.framework into /Library/Frameworks, correct?

The problem is, that even though the CURLHandle project compiles fine, and I copy the resulting framework binaray into /Library/Frameworks, I get an error when trying to build and run CURLHandleTester:

Tool:0: Command /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/Resources/pbxcp failed with exit code 1

Tool:0: /Users/DeadJB/Desktop/CURLHandle (All Sources)/CURLHandleTester/../Frameworks: No such file or directory

So I tried to create a Frameworks directory in the parent folder, and then I copied the CURLHandle.framework file into that directory. Now I get these errors when trying to build and run:

/Users/DeadJB/Desktop/CURLHandle (All Sources)/CURLHandleTester/TestController.h:5:34: error: CURLHandle/CURLHandle.h: No such file or directory


/Users/DeadJB/Desktop/CURLHandle (All Sources)/CURLHandleTester/TestController.h:6:41: error: CURLHandle/CURLHandle+extras.h: No such file or directory

So what should I do to solve this problem? I feel like I'm missing something obvious, so please forgive me if this question is so trivial. I just want to be able to get CURLHandleTester working so that I can know how to use CURLHandle in my own project, since I need the extra features it provides over NSURLConnectiton.


----

libcurl is there on os x 10.4.

The framework above makes use of it:

I'd say you need to add the curl system library to your frameworks (see man page for curl_easy_cleanup).
On my system it's located under:

/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libcurl.dylib
