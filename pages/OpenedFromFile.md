Hello,

Does anyone know of a way to check if a non-document-based app has been opened from a file (e.g. by opening an associated file type in Finder) before application:openFile is actually called?

I thought of checking [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] arguments] to see if it has more args than usual, but I wasn't sure how reliable this would be.

Thanks for any help!

*What are you trying to do?*

Basically, my app saves all its data between sessions.  So when it is run I need to know whether it has been run normally (in which case I want to display the previous session data) or run by opening a file (in which case I don't want to display the session data, just the opened file data).

And because my session data is restored in awakeFromNib of my mainWindowController, I'm trying to find a why to skip the session restore if application:openFile: will be called right afterwards...

*I would suggest redesigning things a bit, and restoring your session data from     - (BOOL)applicationOpenUntitledFile:(NSApplication *)sender;, which is pretty much what it's for. That should make everything work as expected.*

Thanks for the suggestion, I gave this a shot but applicationOpenUntitledFile: never gets called.  Is this still supposed to be called in a non-document based app?  You suggestion does seem like a better way to do things if I can get it to work...

*I'm almost certain that it is, and this is how NSDocument-based apps implement stuff, by using those methods. I'm not sure why yours isn't getting called, but I suggest investigating and possibly implementing     - (BOOL)applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile:(NSApplication *)sender;. It's possible that if you don't implement it, the default behavior is NO, but again, I'm not sure.*

This is very strange...I've tried implementing both applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile (which the docs say does return YES by default) and applicationOpenUntitledFile with an NSLog in each, and neither gets called.

I also noticed that if I remove my applicationShouldHandleReopen delegate, close my mainWindow, and click on the doc icon, both applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile and applicationOpenUntitledFile DO get called (but not when applicationShouldHandleReopen exists, I assume because this overrides the newDocument behavior).

But oddly enough, neither of the "OpenUntitledFile" delegates get called at startup.  I'd love to hear any suggestions...I'm pretty stumped.

In the main NIB file of your application, check the window's attribute "Visible at launch time". If this is on, app's delegate method applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile is not called. -- MichalBencur
