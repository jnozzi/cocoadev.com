So far I have received 16 postcards for Flurry. Mostly form the US and Canada, but a few from Sweden, Germany and Taiwan amoungst others. If I ever get a scanner I will post them on my site. 

GUIdo (generic GUI for UNIX commands like tar and ping)

GUIdo  never really took off. Too advanced for beginners and too simple for pros. Still, a good learning experience for me, and my first (rather awful) experiment with Cocoa. 

I'm a student at Edinburgh University, Scotland. Originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland. 

I got a job working for Zonic (http://www.zonic.co.uk) this summer (they ported Black & White to the Mac). Finally I'm going to make some money from my coding :)
