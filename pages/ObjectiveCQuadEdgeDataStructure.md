Hi all!

I am working to implement in Objective C a class QuadEdge based on Guibas and Stolfi's data structure for a GIS spatial data class. I have some design questions. I hope some people can help me in figuring these out.

I have found 3 implementations. Here are the abreiviated headers:

    -C : http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~stolfi/EXPORT/software/c/libquad/

    
typedef int edge_ref;

typedef struct {
    edge_ref next[4]; //Stores ONext, SymDNext, RotRNext, TorLNext
    void *data[4];    //Stores origin, destination, LeftFace, RightFace
    unsigned mark;
  } edge_struct;

/* Edge orientation operators: */

#define ROT(e) (((e)&0xfffffffcu)+(((e)+1)&3u))
#define SYM(e) (((e)&0xfffffffcu)+(((e)+2)&3u))
#define TOR(e) (((e)&0xfffffffcu)+(((e)+3)&3u))


    -C++ : http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/scs/cs/15-463/pub/src/a2/quadedge.html

    
class QuadEdge;
class Edge {
   friend QuadEdge;
   private:
      int num;
      Edge *next;
      Point2d *data;
};

class QuadEdge {
   private:
      Edge e[4];
};

inline Edge* Edge::Rot()
   //Return the dual of the current edge
   {
      return (num < 3) ? this + 1 : this - 3;
   }

inline Edge* Edge::Sym()
   {
      return (num < 2) ? this + 2 : this -2;
   }

inline Edge* Edge::invRot()
   {
      return (num > 0) ? this - 1 : this + 3;
   }


    -Delphi : "The Quad-Arc Data Structure" by C Gold

    
TQuad = class
   N : TQuad;
   R : TQuad;
   V : TPoint;
   Index : Integer;
end;

function TQuad.Rot : TQuad;
begin
   Sym := Self.R;
end;

function TQuad.Sym : TQuad;
begin
   Sym := Self.R.R;
end;

function TQuad.Inv : TQuad;
begin
   Sym := Self.R.R.R;
end;



The 3 use different approaches and I am trying to decide which approach to use to make a ObjectiveC class. I would like my QuadEdge class to have the following variables:

NSString* edgeId;   Unique ID for each edge.
NSString* lineId;   Unique ID for each line composed of edges.
id vertex;   Refers to either a point or a face.

I have tried it using the following header based on the Delphi implementation:

    
@interface GISEdge : NSObject {
    NSString* lineId;
    NSString* edgeId;
    GISEdge* next;
    GISEdge* rotate;
    id vertex;
    BOOL internal;  // Edge is inside the hull of the TIN (1) or on the edge is part of the outer hull (0)
}


But this implementation seems to be way too bloated because each edge has 4 GISEdge structures. If a Voronoi diagram of any significant size uses this structure, it will be way too big, won't it?

So back to the drawing board. I looked at the C++ implementation and started:

    
typedef struct edge Edge;
struct edge {
    int num;
    Edge* next;
    id data;
};

@interface GISEdge : NSObject {
    NSString* lineId;
    NSString* edgeId;
    Edge e[4];
}


But if next points to edge[2] of QuadEdge "PR102", how can I get the edgeId for edge[2]? This seems too complicated. Yet I like the fact that the edgeId, lineId, and interior variables are only stored once and are associated where they should be, in the QuadEdge and not in the Edge. I could also add new items to the QuadEdge later without a 4x increase in size for every edge.

Another thought that has crossed my mind is to create a GISLayer class that hides individual edges. This would be more like the Symbol-Table Abstract Data Types I learned in Sedgewick's Algorithms books. 

This data structure is more advanced than anything I have done before. Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated!

If it is already available as a C library then why do you want to go and re-implement it in Objective-C? I would simply write a couple of helper classes to wrap the entire library. RbrtPntn.
