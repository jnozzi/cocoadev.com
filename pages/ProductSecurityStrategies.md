It is high time that CocoaDev had an organized approach to discussing product security and registration issues. People's livelihoods are at stake. But that does not mean that people's *lives* are at stake. Perspective is important.

The discussion in CocoaInsecurity and MakingSecureRegistrationCodes contains much duplication, digression, and opinion, as well as many fine suggestions for how to approach the matter in a serious way

SoftwareSerializationPiracyDiscussion and MakingSecureRegistrationCodes are where writers vent their fury about piracy *and* strategy

There are certainly solid suggestions and alternatives contained in the other topics, but they get somewhat lost in the noise sometimes

For example, since there is no universal agreement that any scheme is 100% bulletproof, one has to decide what level of insecurity to accept. This is not *exactly* a strategy, but a decision which must be left up to the individual developer or shop. Nevertheless, you cannot make any other security decisions until you have made that one. Desire for 100% security is, in some sense, neurotic.
