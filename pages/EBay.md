EBay - Massive online auction site.  http://www.ebay.com

You can (sometimes) get awesome deals on new/used books, computers, and peripherals here.

For example, here's a link that will bring up any available books on Cocoa programming:

http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&query=cocoa+mac

*(DOH!!!  Someone *really* needs to fix this site so that it can correctly display links that contain an amperstand '&')*

Well...  Actually it DOES DISPLAY the link properly.  It just doesn't create the <A HREF> tag accurately so that the link will work.  Just copy the link and paste it into the URL bar and it will work.
