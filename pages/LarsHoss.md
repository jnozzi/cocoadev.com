My name is Lars Hoss. I'm 26 years old and I'm from Munich, Germany.

Started C and 68K Assembler programming on the Amiga 500. Switched
to Linux and Windows afterwards. Bought my very first Mac (733MHz QuickSilver)
some weeks ago to get my hands on MacOS X.

In my free time I am still working on a graphical CVS client for MacOS X.
I would like to write some smaller articles for beginners in order
to help them to prevent the pitfalls I faced. 

I have released my first small app called PopWatch ( http://popwatch.highteq.net ). I have released the source as well because I thought it might help others when starting with Cocoa.
