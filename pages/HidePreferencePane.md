I wonder if there is a way to remove PreferencePanes or deactivate them, if there is some kind of toggle. I notice that putting a .(dot) infront doesn't change anything... and i'm not sure if i want to move them to another location

There's a PrefPane called Diablotin that disables other pref panes, but I think it just automates the moving to another location.

You can right click and choose remove from the menu too.
