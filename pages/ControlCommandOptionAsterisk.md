Seems to change screen to black and white and invert. Any Idea why? Im sure plenty of you have seen this before.

This is an accessibility feature of Jaguar - Some people have difficulty seeing and find it easier / less stressful on the eye to have the screen inverted - so it's mostly black.

**There's also a trick which allows you to actually invert the colours on the screen... that's right, the Apple logo in the corner goes orange! I think you click the Switch to Grayscale button, then invert the screen with the key combo, then click Switch to Grayscale again.**

Yup thats works (don't like it though!)

**It's not bad at 3 AM, as long as your desktop picture doesn't cause too much radiation.**
