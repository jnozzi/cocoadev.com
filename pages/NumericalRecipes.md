Numerical Recipes is a book of recipes for various numerical computational tasks in different programming languages. See http://www.nr.com (the C version of the book is availiable online for free)

The code samples are pretty bad, being transliterated Pascal, from transliterated FORTRAN in the original.  But the basic algorithms described are generally OK to get you started.  Then you can move on to the more current algorithms available.
