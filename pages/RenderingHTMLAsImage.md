Is it possible to render HTML directly as an image?  I've been trying to do the following:

    
webView mainFrame] loadRequest:[[[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:myURL]];
NSView* tempView = [webView mainFrame] frameView] documentView];
[[NSData* imageData = [tempView dataWithPDFInsideRect:[tempView bounds]]
[previewFrame setImage:[[[NSImage alloc] initWithData:imageData] autorelease]];


However, previewFrame stays empty.  The peculiarity of this code is that webView is initialized with 'WebView* webView = [[WebView alloc] init];' and is never displayed in the GUI.

So, my question is, is there a way to get this method to work?  Or is there a simpler way to directly render the HTML as an image without all this mucking about with views?

(The reason I want this to be not simply a WebView is that I want links to be disabled and the content to be scalable.)

Thanks.

Read the WebView docs. You can customize virtually everything about webpages.

Related to your code, you may need to wrap     dataWithPDFInsideRect: inside calls to lockFocus and unlockFocus on your tempView.

*No, there is no need to lock or unlock focus here. The problem is that loadRequest: is asynchronous; you have to give it time to work. Send that, and set up a delegate to get notified when the load is complete. Once that gets called, then you can grab your PDF and go.*

I tried to get this to to work by setting up the delegate, but that didn't seem to work.  So, is there a way to simply render the HTML directly as an image?  Or am I barking up the wrong tree?

*Code*, show us your *code*. :-)

Here you go. But it's probably better to use NSBitmapRep's     initWithFocusedViewRect: and generate an NSImage from that instead of a PDF. --KevinWojniak

	// assumes webView is initalized somewhere already...
	[webView setFrameLoadDelegate:self];
	webView mainFrame] loadRequest:[[[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.apple.com/ipod"]]];
}

- (void)webView:(WebView *)sender didFinishLoadForFrame:(WebFrame *)frame
{
	NSView *tempView = [sender mainFrame] frameView] documentView];
	[[NSData *pdfData = [tempView dataWithPDFInsideRect:[tempView bounds]];
	[pdfData writeToFile:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/Desktop/test.pdf", NSHomeDirectory()] atomically:YES];
}
