A really good(*) developer mailing list maintained by the Omni Group in Seattle.

*really good is the content and the contributors, really bad is the mailing list software... it's been having some "issues" lately.

----
The Omni list is a good place to ask questions about using unsupported API and the like - you're more likely to get a useful answer there than on the official Apple lists.
