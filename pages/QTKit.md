QTKit is  an Objective-C interface to QuickTime available on Tiger, and also available with QT7 on Panther. It supercedes the Cocoa classes NSMovieView and NSMovie with a larger set of classes which provide a comprehensive interface into QuickTime from Objective-C. In addition to basic playback and tweaking, QTKit allows full-blown editing and other such goodies.

QTKit is also the name of an open-source wrapper around QuickTime that was made outside of Apple. For information on that wrapper, see the QTKitOSS page.
