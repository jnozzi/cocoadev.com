Long time Unix/C/C++/Java hacker getting excited by Cocoa

Heh, seems like someone saw the movie "Hackers" a little bit too often :-) ( Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie )  *Uh, no. It's a ridiculous movie targeting know-nothing wannabes where all GUIs are virtual reality (even for opening files) and all secret files can be accessed by typing "ACCESS SECRET FILES" in huge, blinking, red text. The movie and its creators should be burned.* **That's the TV operating system for you, folks!** *Yeah, and in the TVOS culture, it's considered impolite NOT to announce, "I'm in!" when you've ... well ... ACCESSED SECRET FILES.*

Why don't you tell us what you *really* think.

* ... I just did. ;-) However, I'd be happy to go into more detail if you'd like.*

You're just jealous that YOU didn't hack the Gibson.  - JustinWilliams

*Yeah, but you should see what I hacked up when I had pneumonia ... Now THAT'S hacking... ;-)*
