I've been exploring WebKit and WebCore a bit and I was wondering if there's a way to access or traverse the DOM tree for a document loaded in a web frame?

----

You can do it with JavaScript (with WebView's -stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:), but I'm not sure that it's possible to do it in a nice way in ObjC-code. I messed around a bit with WebCore and the DOM when working on IconaraDOM, but from lack of documentation I grew tired of it.

So I guess the DOM tree viewer is internal to Safari? Too bad....

Looks like there's a new DOM API in 10.3.9 and Tiger. I'm just starting to look into it, but hopefully it allows you to fully read and manipulate the DOM from ObjC.
