I am trying to load a movie from a URL and I am having a problem I don't quite understand.  
Here's the code:
    
// movieView is the QTMovieView
[movieView setMovie:[QTMovie movieWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.myurl.com/movies/1.mov"]
                                    error:nil]];

And the error is 

    *** -[MovController setMovie:]: selector not recognized [self = 0x398180]

I looked on the net a bit, and can't find anyone who has had a similar problem.  I tried looking through Apple's QTKitPlayer example, but it throws an exception when I try loading a movie from a URL.  I double-checked the URL and it is correct.  I also tried with a local URL with no luck.
Any help or insight is appreciated.

Thanks,

It has nothing to do with the validity of the URL. The error is telling you that your comment is wrong.     movieView is not a QTMovieView, it is a MovController. Whatever that is (one of your classes, obviously), it does not understand the     setMovie: message, so it dies when you try to send it.

I think I'm missing something.  MovController is one of my classes, it extends NSWindowController.  I added a QTMovieView in Interface Builder and linked it to an outlet called     movieView of the QTMovieView type.  I don't get how it sees     movieView as a MovController.

Here is my relevant code in MovController.h
    
#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>
#import <QTKit/QTKit.h>

@interface MovController : NSWindowController {
    QTMovieView *movieView;
}

- (void)loadMovie;

@end


And in MovController.m
    
#import "MovController.h"

@implementation MovController

- (id)init
{
    self = [super initWithWindowNibName:@"Movie"];
    return self;
}

- (void)loadMovie
{
    [movieView setMovie:[QTMovie movieWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.myurl.com/movies/1.mov"]
                                        error:nil]];   
}

@end


I'm sure it's a simple error, but I can't put my finger on it.

EDIT: Forgot     IBOutlet.  I knew it was a simple mistake...

I'm not getting any errors or warnings anymore, but the QTMovieView does not appear to get updated.  When I created the .nib file, I set the     File: parameter to a local movie on my machine.  When I saw that it is working, I removed this parameter (    File: is now blank).  But, whatever URL I pass to     setMovie, it still plays the old local file.  I don't see where this reference is coming from, it's nowhere in my code.  Is there a QT cache or something similar that keeps playing the file?  Why is it not getting updated with     setMovie?
