**Comments:**

For an official WWDC hotel, internet service is sure unreliable and pricey (my stay was in 2004). And Paris wasn't available for 'personal service,' to make up for it, either. Avoid.

Looks like a great hotel and  an absolute steal at 70 bucks. Great breakfast spot nearby and across the street from Macy's.
Only down side is parking is too expensive. 36 bucks a night. -Lemont Washington

Villa Florence
http://www.villaflorence.com/

3 Stars, looks very nice. Pricelined it for $70/night. Looks like 3 blocks from Moscone. Website doesn't say anything about A/C so lets hope its not a scorcher in SFO this summer.

The Mosser
http://www.themosser.com/

A few people I know have recommended this place. No A/C or high speed internet. Some rooms have shared bathrooms. I booked it via http://www.orbitz.com for $159/night for a Deluxe (private bathroom) Queen room. According to the reviews the rooms are small but it looks to be close to Moscone.

As WWDC draws closer: http://www.ratestogo.com usually is a great place to get last-minute deals (up to 20 days in advance) on hotels. For now I have to note that there seems to be no terrific deal. Hotel Nikko actually is more expensive there than noted on this page. I guess hotels are feeling the start of summer tourism, General/JavaOne, WWDC, ... . Yet those who Pricelined got better deals on some of the hotels listes at
