Hey, I have an NSTableView and a subclass of NSTextFieldCell used as the table's main column's data cell.

The rows in the table are slightly large, and I would like the field editor to be neatly centered in the row when double clicking for editing.  I would also like to change the color of the text inside the field editor.  How can I modify the field editor for the cell so that I can specify a custom frame and text color?  I have tried using setupFieldEditorAttributes -- but have had little success. Any ideas?  Thanks.

Override the cell editing methods editWithFrame:... and selectWithFrame: ... and modify the passed rectangle before calling thru super... after the super call, you can also mess with the text object that's passed as an argument to adjust text color.

Works like a charm, thanks.
