Features/fixes to existing non-Apple tools, or just tools you wish you had but don't have time to make (and maybe someone else will!)

----



* A fast, full-featured open source file browser. It'd probably never fully replace Finder, but it'd be nice to be able to view directories containing thousands of items without resorting to Terminal.app

* A CMM (Contextual Menu Module) that just puts the Services menu in the contextual menu. I know about ICECoFFEE, and have it installed, but I don't care about double-clicking on URLs and I just don't like having ApplicationEnhancer installed just for this. It seems like it'd be pretty easy to do - just grab the Services menu and stick it in there. But I lack CodeWarrior (you can't do CMMs with XCode, AFAIK)

* A command-line tool which opens an arbitrary dictionary plist, extracts the value for a given key, and gives it to stdout. Hoping someone else will make this. :-) Sample useage: plistvalue mydict.plist MyKeyName > storeItHere.txt

Ask and ye possibly may receive if someone gets bored enough. -- MikeFletcher
