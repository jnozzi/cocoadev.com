The new (in 10.3) API in HIServices for working with pasteboards. PasteboardManager replaces both the Scrap Manager (which worked with the Clipboard) and Drag Manager (for drag-and-drop), and provides more functionality than NSPasteboard. PasteboardManager also exclusively uses CoreFoundation types, making it much simpler to work with than the two Managers before it.
