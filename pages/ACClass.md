     In Objective-C class methods and instance methods are actually stored in two separate classes
     By default, a class and it's meta class have the same name.
 
     So, an ACClass object created from [NSObject class] won't include class methods, such as alloc
     such methods are accessible only via [NSObject class]->isa

     ACClass alloc] initWithClass: [NSObject class]->isa];
