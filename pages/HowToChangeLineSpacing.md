I am putting together a dictionary with attributes to use with an attributed string:

    

NSMutableParagraphStyle* pStyle = [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init];
	[pStyle setLineSpacing:-70];
	smallWhiteFont = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys: [NSFont fontWithName:@"Helvetica" size:9.5], NSFontAttributeName, 
																	titleColor, NSForegroundColorAttributeName, 
																	pStyle, NSParagraphStyleAttributeName,
																	[NSNumber numberWithFloat:-5.0], NSBaselineOffsetAttributeName,
																	nil];



But my NSMutableParagraphStyle isn't doing anything?! The string I am trying to alter is just somehting like @"abc \n abc" And the second 'abc' is too far away from the top 'abc' so i just want to bring the line spacing down so they are closer together... but the above has no effect on line spacing :-S

The documentation says that the linespacing must be a positive number, contrary to my example above. However, there is no difference in the outcome with a positive number - the problem remains.

Try doing     pStyle = [[NSParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle] mutableCopy]. That works for me.
