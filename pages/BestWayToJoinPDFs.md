I'm trying to join several PDFs into one in my applications. Right now, I'm using joinPDF (http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/~g.briscoe/joinPDF/) from an NSTask and  it seems to work fine. However I just noticed that Automator can join PDFs too, so I was wondering if there was a native way to join PDFs in Cocoa. If not, can I use an Automator action within my application to join the PDFs, and will this be faster or slower than using joinPDF? Thanks in advance, - PabloGomez
