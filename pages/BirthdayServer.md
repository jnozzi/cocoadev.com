*Use     whois - It's registered to a David Thorpe. The e-mail address is in the record.*

- Yes that's me! - Please, take the BirthdayServer code and use as you like. The NetSocket library is under a BSD license (or similar) I think - DavidThorpe

- This is now redundant as modern versions of iCal can do this now. However, the Cocoa HTTP server embedded within it may still be useful - DavidThorpe, 7 September 2006
