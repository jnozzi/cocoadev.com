I was wondering how can I programmatically monitor changes to a file. Essentially, I would like to monitor the nodes.plist file in the Application Support of iCal. 
Anytime this file is written to, I would like to know. I've read about gfslogger, but that is overkill and does not monitor a file but reads system file events. 
Any pointers on this?
Thanks
