As folks add new content to CocoaDev SpellingErrors are likely to occur. Here are some tips for dealing with SpellingErrors:


* If you are reading the site and you encounter a spelling error, just fix it. Don't add a note to the page saying "hey, dumb-ass, check your spelling! har har!" or "I fixed your typos!" Just fix it. Make it look like the author typed it correctly the first time.
* If you post to CocoaDev regularly, consider using a web browser that features a built-in spell checker, such as OmniWeb or Safari. It will save your bacon. Alternatively, compose your posts in another editor such as TextEdit.


The chore of maintaining the wiki content and keeping it "presentable" falls to all of us. Thanks for your support.
