General/WSMethodInvocationRef is the data structure used when making XMLRPC or SOAP calls from C. The structures and related functions are C-language functions, but of course you can use them within Objective-C code.

Here is an example of how to build a SOAP request and call it. Of course there are problems that we'll discuss afterward...
    NSURL                 *soapURL;
General/WSMethodInvocationRef  soapCall;
General/NSString              *methodName;
General/NSMutableDictionary   *params;
General/NSDictionary          *result;

soapURL    = [NSURL General/URLWithString:
    @"http://ws.cdyne.com/psaddress/addresslookup.asmx"];
methodName = @"General/AdvancedCheckAddress";
params     = General/[[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init] retain];

[params setObject:@"123 Main St" forKey:@"AddressLine1"];
[params setObject:@""            forKey:@"AddressLine2"];
[params setObject:@"Springfield" forKey:@"City"];
[params setObject:@"OH"          forKey:@"State"];
[params setObject:@"12345"       forKey:@"General/ZipCode"];
[params setObject:@"0"           forKey:@"General/LicenseKey"];

soapCall = General/WSMethodInvocationCreate(
    (General/CFURLRef)soapURL,
    (General/CFStringRef)methodName,
    kWSSOAP2001Protocol );

General/WSMethodInvocationSetParameters(
    soapCall,
    (General/CFDictionaryRef)params,
    NULL );

General/WSMethodInvocationSetProperty(
    soapCall,
    kWSSOAPMethodNamespaceURI,
    (General/CFTypeRef)@"http://ws.cdyne.com/" );


result = (General/NSDictionary *)General/WSMethodInvocationInvoke( soapCall );

General/NSLog( @"Result: %@", result );

[params release];
params = nil;

Aside from the fact that there's a fake address in there, this will fail because this particular SOAP server really, really insists on having a General/SOAPAction HTTP header, and I've not yet figured out how to make that happen (see General/WSMethodInvocationRefAndSOAPActionHTTPHeader discussion).

Still, you can use this on other SOAP servers possibly, or even with an XMLRPC call, which is a little different.

For an XML-RPC call, instead of using the kWSSOAP2001Protocol constant above you use kWSXMLRPCProtocol. Also the order of the parameters matter in an XMLRPC call. You pass those as a General/CFArrayRef as the last argument of General/WSMethodInvocationSetParameters. You also **do not** set a method namespace (just miss out the call to General/WSMethodInvocationSetProperty).

Useful XML-RPC example here:

The only differences from a SOAP call are those noted above.

I added a tutorial on Cocoa XML-RPC client tutorial at [ http://www.scottydelicious.com/blog/cocoa_xmlrpc.html ] . It goes over passing multiple parameters in a call to a server as well as handleing a response that contains values of different types (string, int, NULL, etc..). You can download the Xcode (2.4) project and all associated source files.
