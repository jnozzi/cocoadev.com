A friend of mine tried my beta program on his machine, and got this error in his terminal:

    Last login: Sun Apr 24 20:06:29 on console

Trace/BPT trap

[Process completed]

I thought the ZeroLink had to do with the compiling of the program, and is part of XCode.  Since my friend doesn't have XCode (as he's not a developer), the program wouldn't run for him.  Does anyone know why this could be happening?

ZeroLink has to do with the linking of the program. ZeroLink'd applications won't run on any computer other than the one it's built on.

*You will have to clean your target and build it in Deployment mode.*
