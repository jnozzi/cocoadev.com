Which three of these codes is the best to communicate with a objc server?

or are there others for objc/cocoa?

I am a newbie to NSConnection.

Tnx

The first and third techniques are mostly equivalent (except the third won't work with IPv6, etc.). There's no reason to pick the more complicated way over the simpler way.

The second technique sets up an NSConnection over Mach ports and won't work for remote computers.
