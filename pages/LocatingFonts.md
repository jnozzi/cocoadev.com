Hi,

Is there any way I could create a font with NSFont fontWithFontName or use a font from the shared font library (or any other method) and locate it's path then show it in the finder?

So far my only ideas are to loop through the font folders looking for the font and if it is found, showing it.

Is that the best solution, or is there a simpler/more effecient/better solution?

thanks
