I'm having difficulties using the distributed build feature under XcodeOneDotFive.  Distccd jams on the first file it encounters for remote processing -- the checksum can't be compared.  Has anyone used distributed builds under xc 1.5?  If so, could you detail your setup.  Needless to say, all appropraite ports etc are open, OS and compiler and xcode versions all match.

In 1.2 (for me) the first one never worked but all subsequent distcc invokations worked fine; haven't tried it in 1.5. ï¿½BrentGulanowski

Okay, can you tell me a bit about your setup?
