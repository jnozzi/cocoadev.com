HowToAndWhyWithDocklings - Trying to make a good resource for developing docklings... unless anyone know of such a place already?

First up is me... How do I dynamically change the icon of a dockling? I know how to do it in an Application.

How exactly are you implementing your dockling? Ye olde dockling API of 10.0.x or NSDockExtra (if that even works, not sure).

I've only tried the old dockling API. Didn't know of any NSDockExtra. Any hints/tips/pointers etc. are very welcome! :-)

Ok. After a lot of trial and error I figured a way of doing this. Thnx to someones EightBall dockling. Here's the code needed, using the old Dockling API:
    
- (void)changeImage:(NSImage *)newImage
{
    NSImageView *iconView = [[NSImageView alloc]
            initWithFrame:NSMakeRect(0.0, 0.0, 128.0, 128.0)];

    [iconView setImage: newImage];
     
    self window] setContentView:iconView];
    [iconView release];
    [[self window] setBackgroundColor:[[[NSColor clearColor]];
    self window] display];
}

Developing docklings with the old API leaves you no way of loading it inside Project Builder to view debugging information etc. Still, there is a way to become a bit more enlighted when errors occur. Use the standard [[NSLog function for printing out info as your docklet runs, to view these log messages, open the Console.app in /Applications/Utilities/. Very handy indeed :-)

Has anybody had any success with putting pictures into dockling menus? I haven't :(

It doesn't work. Sorry :(
