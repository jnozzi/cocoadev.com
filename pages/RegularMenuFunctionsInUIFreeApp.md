I have an app which has no UI, via having no mainmenu and the LSUIElement tag in Info.plist.  However, my app still has text fields and I'd like to be able to copy/paste, etc, and possibly exercise other FirstResponder actions.  Without the menu and it's default connections, there doesn't seem to be any straightforward way for setting app-wide keyboard actions.  How can I enable things like apple-, for prefs, etc?

Just go ahead and keep the main menu in your nib file, and as long as the LSUIElement is set to 1, the menu won't show in the menubar but it will still work.
