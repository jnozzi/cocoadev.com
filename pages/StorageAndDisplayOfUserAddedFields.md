I'm currently working on creating what is essentially a simple database for tracking customers and other things related to an industry. I can't decide how to represent custom fields that are added by the user.  I've thought about using fairly standard data model objects with an General/NSMutableDictionary used to store all of the custom field names and their data.  I'm just curious if there is a better way to do this using the cocoa framework that I don't know about yet.  

I'm having more difficulty deciding what to do in displaying these fields to the user.  Originally, I thought that I could programatically modify an General/NSForm to do the trick, but I would like to be able to display more than just text data.  From what I've been able to ascertain, I might be able to create a subclass of General/NSMatrix that would work, but I don't really know how I would implement that yet.  The other option that I'm looking at is providing views to an General/NSTableView like this http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/2003-12-20.01.html and using that to display the data.  

I don't have much experience with the Cocoa framework yet, so if I'm missing something completely obvious, forgive me. Any ideas on how to implement this efficiently would be appreciated.

Look at General/QuickLite for an example. It uses a tableview for display, textfield for input, and has all the interaction with the General/SQLite database you probably need.
