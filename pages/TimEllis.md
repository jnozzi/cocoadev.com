 

After I went to WWDC in 2005 whilst working at Ultralab I started putting time into cocoa and playing around, and I've grown quite fond of the environment, but still a bit of a newbie. I try to blog useful bits and bobs and release open source code where possible so others can help me learn and hopefully also pick up a few things!
