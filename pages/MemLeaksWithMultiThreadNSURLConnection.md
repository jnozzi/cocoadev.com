Hi There:

I'm having some issues with Memory Leaking from NSURLConnection (either from calling it directly, or when it's used in another method [eg initWithContentsOfURL]. The problem seems to appear when it's used on a thread other than the main one. Here's my code:

    

// This is released when the program begins, by a thread that is in turn released by the initWithFrame method

- (void)getNextPhotos:(id)anObject
{	
	
	NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
	
	gettingMorePhotos = YES;
	
	// start a loop...
	while (1) {
	
	NSLog(@"checking to see if we need to get some photos....");
	
	if ([nextPhotos count] < 10 && hasSession == YES) {
		
		// take the friends and shuffle it
		if ([filteredFriends count] > 0) {
			[self randomizeArray:filteredFriends];
			
			//[nextPhotos removeAllObjects];
			
			// grab the top five, get their photos
			
				
				if ([filteredFriends objectAtIndex:0]) {
				
					int i;
					for (i=0; i < 3; i++) {
						// changed this loop around a bit to ensure that we get enough photos for when sequential = 1
						
						if ([filteredFriends objectAtIndex:i]) {
							
							[self getUserPhotos:filteredFriends objectAtIndex:i] uid;
							
							
							}
						
						if ([nextPhotos count] > 10) {
							i = 3;
							
							}
						
						}
					}
				}
		}
	
	// sleep for a bit
	sleep(3);
	
	}	
		[pool release];
	
}



/// the method above in turn calls this method...
- (void)getUserPhotos:(NSString *)uid
{
	
	
	
	// get the user photos and put them in an array
	tempphotos = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:100];
	
	NSMutableDictionary *tempDictionary = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];	
	[tempDictionary setValue:@"facebook.photos.get" forKey:@"method"];
	[tempDictionary setValue:api_key forKey:@"api_key"];

	NSString * current_time = [self getCurrentTime];
	[tempDictionary setValue:current_time forKey:@"call_id"];
	[tempDictionary setValue:uid forKey:@"subj_id"];
	
	//NSLog(uid);

														  error:nil];
	//NSString *tempString;
	
	
	if([tokenXML rootElement] name] isEqualToString:@"photos_get_response"])
	{
			[[NSLog(@"photos getting..");

			id aNode;

								}
							
							}
						
						[tempphotos addObject:tempPhoto];
						
						[tempPhoto release];
						
						}
					
					}
				
				}
			
			if ([tempphotos count] > 1) {
				[self randomizeArray:tempphotos];
			}
			
			
			// limit to sequential photos
			int i3;
			for (i3 = 0; i3 < sequentialPhotos; i3++) {

	} else {

I don't *think* there are any leaks in the code... but MallocDebug says otherwise. It's a screensaver, so it's running for a long time - and thus memory leaks are a big issue.

I've tried to use curlHandle - but I couldn't get it to link properly. Could this have something to do with it being a screensaver?

Any help would be appreciated...

Thanks,
Alexandre

There's a well-known bug that     sendSynchronousRequest: will leak when used from multiple threads. The workaround is to use the asynchronous delegate-based NSURLConnection methods instead.

----
Hmm... OK, thanks. I'm assuming Apple is aware of this bug?

I wouldn't asume that, I did submit a bug that was also well known, but it toke a long time before it became a duplicate. I would say submit it anyway, it will also get more and more awareness.

It looks like it's pretty well known, both in and outside of Apple:

http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=nsurlconnection+leak+site:cocoabuilder.com&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

However, filing a bug wouldn't hurt; Apple uses the number of bugs filed about a particular problem to help determine which ones should be fixed first.

Ok, so right now I'm trying to set up the asynchronous connection. I can do it fine when I run it from the main thread, but I run into problems when I try doing it from a thread that I have detached from the main. The reason I need to do it is because it's a screensaver, and if I do it in the AnimateOneFrame method the animation lags. I've created a new object "Downloader" to use as the delegate. I can set some variables in the Downloader instance that I create so that I know what to do with the data after It's been received (I do several different types of requests, sometimes at the same time). 

Anyways, here's the code:

    

// this is in a different thread, in a loop... so the thread does not exit. Also, this doesn't get called again until the connection is finished (there's a variable called gettingMorePhotos that is set to true to avoid calling two at once).

Downloader *photoDownloader = Downloader alloc] initWithType:@"userPhotos" andMainClass:self];

[photoDownloader setString:[[filteredFriends objectAtIndex:0] uid;
					
NSURLConnection *theConnection=[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:photoDownloader];

if (theConnection) {
						
// Create the NSMutableData that will hold
// the received data
[photoDownloader createData];
						
NSLog(@"Connection created");
						
} else {
						
NSLog(@"could not create connection..");
// inform the user that the download could not be made

}




This code works fine when it's not in a new thread. But when it is in a new thread, the Connection gets created, but the delegate methods do not get called. What's the deal here? What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Alexandre
