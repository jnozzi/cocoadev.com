I've been programming in Cocoa the past few years and I've really enjoyed it.  I'm looking for some experience to see if I'd want to take it from being a hobby to being a career.  I'm looking to take on some free work to test my knowledge and see where it takes me.  If anyone's interested, send me an email at:  CorporateNewt@gmail.com

Thanks.
