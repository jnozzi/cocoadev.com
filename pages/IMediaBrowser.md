iMediaBrowser is project recreating the standard iLife Media Browser.  It attempts to create a special add-in for Cocoa applications that brings iLife integration to any program. It is licensed BSD.

The project is to end users one of two ways: Cocoa developers can incorporate it into their applications or users can download a separate application that displays the browser from http://www.karelia.com/imedia/ .  Users can use the stand-alone browser to drag music, movies, and pictures into any running application.

**The Media Browser is now located at http://code.google.com/p/imedia/ **
This is a public svn repository.
