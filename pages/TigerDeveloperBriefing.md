Will anyone be going to the free Tiger Development Briefing in London? Just wondering. - General/StefanPantos

I am as well, will have to wake up early though. - General/PhilippeRobin

I wish...please tell us all about it - General/JediKnil

Well, I just wish that there was an Apple sanctioned place that we Select/Premium ADC members could discuss Tiger.

Yes, I really don't understand why Apple doesn't start a mailing list.  There's obviously demand.  I suppose one small problem is that they've farmed out searching to google and the like, and they won't allow google to index this one..

*Does Apple ever do anything based on what the developers �demand�? ;)*
