Relatively new to General/ObjC and Cocoa. I've been dabbling in it since Jaguar and General/ProjectBuilder though, but I have yet to release anything serious.

Ideas and attempted projects:

* **Coquo** - the first attempted project. A simple to-do list - "quo" as in "status quo". Version one was your usual General/NSTableView tutorial. Version two was a failed General/CocoaBindings app. Version three - codenamed co2, ironically (*Carbon*-dioxide) - is actually quite interesting - a central class controls the General/NSTableView and a UUID column, and plugins are used to supply additional columns, optionally drawing for themselves and/or supporting extra sheets and views. This idea is half cooked.
* **Treasure** - a simple tile-based game. It's a port of a seemingly addictive graph calculator game an online acquaintance made - I've never actually played it!
* **Surfboard** - your usual browser with plans for world domination. Cancelled about three hours following its inception.
* **Companion** - an experimental General/NSStatusItem menu for combining the online status of your IM buddies and local time and weather based on their location. 
* **ix** - another General/NSStatusItem. Your ordinary OS 9 Apple menu ripoff. ix stands for the roman numeral IX, meaning 9, and is also a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reference (see the Ford Prefect footnote). Can opt out of resolving aliases and displaying files that aren't applications.
* **MDT** [short for M<nowiki/>arkDownTester] - a GUI wrapper around a regression test suite for developers of Markdown interpreters. It never got far. [Markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ ]
* A modified version of the General/MegaManEffect, an entry in an ADHOC/General/MacHack competition by someone that's absolutely not me. Runs in a small bezel in the middle of the screen (seems more OS X-like than hi-jacking the entire screen). Original version at http://www.adhocconference.info/wiki/doku.php?id=megamaneffect (my version available by request; I'm simply too embarrassed by the source to link to it publicly and I want to publish both the source and binary at once).


How to contact me:

* TCP/IP over carrier pigeon [ http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt ]
* Failing availability of such pedestrian technology: wootest PLUS cocoadev AT gmail DOT com (yes, that should transcribe to an actual "    +"! It's a feature of gmail.)

Discussion, for the terminally bored, would go here.
