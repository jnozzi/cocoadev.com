Object oriented + functional programming seems contradictory to me, could someone enlighten me as to how this is at all possible, or desirable? To me, object oriented programming is a lot about side effects, and functional programming is all about not having side effects at all. On the other hand, I never understood what mondas were all about, so there might be some magic behind this that I haven't grasped. However, I can see that it's nice to be able to embed functional code in object oriented systems, as expression parsers, for example, as in the example on the site above.
