It�s easy to imagine corporate executives drawing org charts, or management folks drawing flowcharts of their processes, and, sure, OmniGraffle makes these tasks fun and easy. But what about the rest of us? Well, diagrams are basic to the way people think, and we create them all the time without even realizing it. Whatever your profession or interests, chances are you�ve occasionally sketched out some ideas on a piece of graph paper or the back of a napkin. Humans are visual creatures, and OmniGraffle is the tool to help us organize our thoughts visually. It sounds high-falutin�, but it�s really simple and fun � OmniGraffle is your digital back-of-napkin.
