I am a 16-year-old Cocoa hopeful from California.

I've been learning C and Cocoa since April, 2003, and have made quite a bit of progress since then.  I'm also relatively seasoned in RealBasic (which isn't much to brag about.)

I'm working on the book FromNothingToCocoa, which will be coming out when it's finished.  I think that writing a book will not only help me learn cocoa, but will help others.  See its page for more info.  I ask a whole lot of questions in discussions, as I think it's the best way to learn.  Soon enough, I'll be a cocoa veteran... I just have to let it happen.

As far as non-cocoa related stuff goes, I speak several languages, the most interesting ones being Thai,  Japanese, Korean, Punjabi, and Mongolian.  Languages are one of my major interests in life.  I am also a big fan of Puroresu, which is the Japanese version of Pro Wrestling (there, not only rednecks and hicks like it, so I guess I'm safe of those insults :P).  I have a 17-inch powerbook, which I treat as a baby, washing my hands every time before I use it, and making sure it stays perfect (though I am experiencing some nasty kernel panics.)

I am a HUGE fan of Indian music.  My favorites are Daler Mehndi, The Colonial Cousins, Hans Raj Hans, Shaan, and Bally Sagoo, respectively.

*Nothing wrong with Indian music, but these pictures are just so... wow... I am speechless...*
