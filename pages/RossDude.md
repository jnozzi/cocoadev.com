Hello, I am Ross!  I am a newbie Cocoa programmer, with about six months experience with Cocoa-Java starting off.  I just started doing Objective-C Cocoa in September of 2003.  I do little free programs, and I want to put some on the internet.  I use this site almost everyday to have reference to work off of.

Hi, interestingly I also started programming when I was 12, at that time we did not have the internet so I had to go to the public library to borrow books about my Commodore 64 :)

I have later learned (in psychology) that modus ponens (logical reasoning) is something that children start to master around the age of 12 (before that they simply cannot understand it).  Since I don't really remember my own modus ponens skills from 16 years ago, I would be interested if you could spare me some thoughts on the subject?

E.g. did you only recently start to program and how difficult was it? do you think you could have started 1-2 years ago? does any of your friends understand what it is you're doing etc.? :)

Also, what got you into programming in the first place?

Hi,

I'm not RossDude but I found this interesting because I started programming when I was seven or eight, thanks to my older siblings all programming on the C64/Vic20/Amstrad etc and teaching me to. I'm sure my code would have been awful back then but I wonder how good my logic was.

RossDude: Well, I don't know how good my logical reasoning is.  I can just sort of see how I need to do stuff in program.  i didn't think programming was that difficult (well, cocoa at least.  i tried windows programming, but it's too hard), but applescript was, which caused my switch to cocoa-java, then the lack of support changed me over to objective c cocoa.  none of my friends have a clue what the heck i am doing.  i did start about 1-2 years ago.

Wow, we have the same first name! 
I'll answer the modus ponens question: It didn't make sense for a few months, then all I did was HTML for awhile, then something clicked.
Simple enough, right? HTML doesn't require logic, so it's easy.

Applescript is pure evil. Java is like some weak melding pot that feels bad to program with, like C++, and Obj-C...
Just... Freakin'.... awsome. -RossLeonardy, the village idiot.

That is a weird coincidence.  ObjectiveC is so awesome!  Love it!

Update: I use PyObjC now.  Don't bombard this page, but I personally prefer Python over ObjC now...
