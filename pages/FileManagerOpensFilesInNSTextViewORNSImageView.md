How would I create an NSOutlineView that handles files like XCode?

----

Interesting how the subject and contents are totally different.

Here is the answer though:

In the developer folder, /Examples/AppKit/OutlineView. Just add some custom NSCell's into the outlineview and you should be able to produce everything you need. -- MatPeterson

I want to know how to I double click a row, then open in the proper NSView depending on its file type.

You mean to display the contents of the file? If you are using an NSSplitView, you just need to switch the views. Perhaps something like this:

    
[splitView replaceSubview:oldView with:newView];
