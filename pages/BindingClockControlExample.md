I have a question about mmalc's Clock Control example (which is at http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/CocoaExamples/controllers.html): I've bound the value to an NSCalendarDate, but the date doesn't get updated when I toggle AM/PM; only when I drag the hands around. Then it will recognize that I've changed the AM/PM.
Am I doing something wrong, or is this just a bug? If so, how would I get around it?

I've already tried asking mmalc, but I didn't get a response.

Thanks.
