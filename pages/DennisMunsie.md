I've been a Unix programmer for the past 8 years, mostly in C and C++.  I've also picked up some Java along the way, though I now much prefer ObjC over both Java and C++.

I've also coded some small freeware/shareware type apps over the years for the Mac, Linux, PalmOS, and even the Gameboy Advance.

I'm currently trying to learn Cocoa programming, and I've been pleasantly surprised by the APIs so far.  Having worked with the old Mac APIs and the Java Swing APIs, Cocoa is so much nicer than either of them.

My home page is http://munsie.dhs.org/ -- just don't expect anything earth shattering there :)
