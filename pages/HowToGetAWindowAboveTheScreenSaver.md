Hey Does anyone know how to get a Window above the screen saver window? I can put Apps at the same level, but not above. I have a warning window I want to appear and will then fade away. I have tried just adding + 1 to the screen saver level when adding the window but no success. I have also tried subtracting 1 :). Also, does anyone know how to ensure my App/Window does not fly away with Expose? Instead it remains... Like the dock does?.

"Thanks for the Expose Answer. Does anyone have any ideas on the screen saver one. I mean how does the login screen get trigger if your screen saver is password protected. It needs to be at a higher level"

I guess a better question then if I am at the screen saver level is how do I get mouse movement to trigger my application?

I'd like to know if there's a way to make a screen saver that can accept kbd/mouse events without exiting screensaver mode.
