Soeren Nils Kuklau has been using Macs since 1992, and been programming (first on a Commodore 64) since about 1990, which was kind of freaky and crazy yet strangely also intriguing.

He's usually around under the nickname chucker.

So far, he has released ��under the "captire" label ��MenuTemperature and DashPrefs, with more in the works.

His blog is at http://chucker.mystfans.com/ ; you can find out more about him through http://chucker.mystfans.com/about-me/ and contact him through, wait for it, http://chucker.mystfans.com/contact/ ��or look at pretty pictures on his Flickr account: http://flickr.com/photos/chucker/
