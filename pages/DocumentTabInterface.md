Does anyone know how to implement a tabbed interface for several documents like Transmit does?

*You might try searching the wiki for tabbed interfaces in general. Safari comes to mind: SafarisTabBarView ... this should point you in the right direction for implementing tabs in general. This links to "Adium", which is an open-source project that implements a tabbed interface.*
