How do I set an alternate image of a button in InterfaceBuilder?

I've tried this      [myButton setImage:@"myImage"]; It doesn't work!

Of course it doesn't work if you are you doing this!     [myButton setAlternateImage:@"myImage"];

Your problem is that you are using a string object when setting the image. You should be using an image object, not the name of an image. If your image is a bundled resource (i.e. you can reference the image by name ->     myImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"myImage"];), then your code should look like this:

    [myButton setAlternateImage:[NSImage imageNamed:@"myImage"]];
