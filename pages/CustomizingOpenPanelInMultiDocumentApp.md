I thought I wanted to do a simple thing: Customize the OpenPanel, so that I can give the option to open other document types than in my info.plist.
Is it really the case that subclassing the NSDocumentController (namely the openDocument: method) is what I have to do?

Any other info on the matter would be greatly appreciated!

On casual inspection, I'd say: looks like. I expect it's not a "standard" operation. Is that a problem, particularly?

You might want to override -runModalOpenPanel:forTypes: also, and have it do the work of making an unusual open panel.

Thanks for the info.

The ideal hint for me would be source code for the TextEdit Open Panel, which does pretty much all the things I would like to do. Is something like that around, somewhere?

You could look at the source code for TextEdit in /Developer/Examples/AppKit/TextEdit to see how TextEdit accomplishes this.
