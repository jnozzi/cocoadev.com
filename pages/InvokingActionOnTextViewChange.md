I was able to make a connection in Interface Builder from a TextField to my Controller that invokes a certain action whenever the text in the field is changed and it loses focus.  Is there a way to invoke this same action when the text in a TextView is changed?

Implement the NSTextView     - (NSRange)textView:(NSTextView *)aTextView willChangeSelectionFromCharacterRange:(NSRange)oldSelectedCharRange toCharacterRange:(NSRange)newSelectedCharRange delegate method.

i actually found it more useful to use     (void)textDidEndEditing:(NSNotification *)aNotification
