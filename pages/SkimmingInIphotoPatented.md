Hi, mates.

What do you guys think about skimming being patented? I dislike it very much, software patents in general, but this especially, because there are lots of things that come to mind I could do with this...
It would be awesome if Apple patented it for Mac OS X developers, so only non-Mac-platform developers cannot use it ;)
Well, I just wanted to know what you guys think about this - it looks really cool.

What is skimming ? Provide a reference to the patent.

I haven't heard that it was patented (proof on that?), but skimming is a "feature" in iLife '08 - mainly iPhoto and iMovie.

You want the proof? You can't handle the proof. Sorry, just had to ;)
Proof from mr. steve jobs himself, during the presentation of the new imac and ilife + iwork. He says they've patented skimming...

I bet Creative will love to hear that, considering their portable devices have been doing it for ages (in Internet-speak).
