A personal Wiki... includes General/FScript support, and a General/DOScriptingArchitecture interface (see Contents/Resources/General/DOSAInfo.html) requires the General/FScript framework installed in Library/Frameworks...

Any thoughts?

Definitely has potential. May I humbly suggest adding the question mark next to General/PagesThatDontExist? Also, have you seen General/VoodooPad (http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad.html)? I used General/VoodooPad a lot back when it was free. Keep up the good work! --General/RobinHP

General/WikiPad is already a name in use: http://www.jera.com/wikipad/
General/VoodooPad Lite is still free: http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopadlite.html

How does it uh... save data? Other than that, I guess General/WikiPad is a start :)

I didn't know about that General/WikiPad... hmmm... thanks, oh, and yes it does save automatically and transparently to user defaults.  With regards to the ? for pages that don't exist... I actually prefer it to be underlined, but I may make it check if that page exists and change the colour of the underline.  The real plan is to open source the app... soon.  I'll post back here after that.

I would suggest including the General/FScript Library in the distribution, good start, have a look at http://blog.scheirich.info/General/PersonalWiki not as easy to use as General/VoodooPad but connect to General/ZWiki and Wikis that do XML-RPC, General/HaRald
