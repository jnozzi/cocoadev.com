nice one - note the sample code project complains about it being made with a newer (> 3.0) version of xcode, and then it fails to build and/or xcode crashes... though easy enough to just create a new project.

----

To fix the 3.0 warning, in Xcode 3.x > 3.0, one should do a Get Info on the project and choose "Xcode 3.0 compatible" from the compatibility dropdown -- EmanueleVulcano

The sample project should be fixed. Sorry about that! Forgot I was on the 3.1 beta.
