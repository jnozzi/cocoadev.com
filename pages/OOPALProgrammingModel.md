OOPAL is a high-level programming model for manipulating objects. It goes beyond the classic "one object at a time" model and provides a way to query and manipulate whole sets of objects at once using the principles and idioms of array programming languages. To do so, it introduces a new messaging abstraction called "message pattern".

OOPAL, which stands for "Object-Oriented Programming and Array Languages integration", is implemented in FScript, an open source scripting language for Cocoa.

Example: given an NSArray named "strings", containing NSString objects, we want to create an array that contains only the strings of length less than 10.

Objective-C:

    
NSString *aString;
NSMutableArray *result = [NSMutableArray array];
NSEnumerator *stringEnumerator = [strings objectEnumerator];
while (aString = [stringEnumerator nextObject])
{
  if ([aString length] < 10) 
    [result addObject:aString];  
}
return result;


F-Script using OOPAL:

    
strings where:strings length < 10


OOPAL can be used from the F-Script environment or directly embedded inside Objective-C code (see the paper about embedding below).

As of OS 10.4 the NSPredicate class allows for a similarly concise query.  Here is the updated Objective-C:

    
return [strings filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"length < 10"]];


Okay, so it's still a bit more wordy than the FScript.  If it weren't it wouldnt' be Cocoa.
