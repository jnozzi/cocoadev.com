Mac OS X 10.2 includes a new General/WebServicesCore Framework (which is part of the General/CoreServices Framework) which allows one to make XML-RPC calls from Cocoa apps. (And Carbon apps, too, by the way.)

General/SimpleObjectAccessProtocol is also used somehow - must read up!

Ranchero has a demo - http://ranchero.com/cocoa/xmlrpcdemo/

Also there are examples in file:///Developer/Examples/Web%20Services/

also see here for a directory of Web Services:

There is an open source app, WSDL2ObjC, that attempts to replace WS-Core altogether:
