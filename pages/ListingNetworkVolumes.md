Hey peoples!

I've devoured NSWorkspace into giving me a list of paths to all mountedLocalVolumes, this lists everything from the hard disks to cds to network volumes. NSWorkspace has another option to list the paths of mountedRemovableMedia. This will give ipods/firewire drives, network volumes and cds. However, I want to be able to single out certain volume types, namely being network volumes. I want to be able to get a list of hard disks, a separate list of removable media, and then a separate list of only network volumes. NSWorkspace unfortunately wont allow this. Is there any possible way of doing this? I have done it in Applescript Studio so it is most definately possible in cocoa.

Thanks
Cheers
