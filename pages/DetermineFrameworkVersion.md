Is there a way to determine the current version of a Framework? For example I'd like to check if WebKit is of a minimum version in my code.

I've looked at the NSApplication version info, but that only seems to indicate up to 10.2.3, and seems specific to NSApp class only.

Get an NSBundle pointing to the framework (using     +bundleWithIdentifier: is probably the best route) and then look at the CFBundleVersion in its info dictionary.

*Ah, yes! Works perfectly:*
    NSLog(@"WebKit v.%@",[[[NSBundle bundleWithIdentifier:@"com.apple.WebKit"] infoDictionary] valueForKey:@"CFBundleVersion"]);
