Snippet for getting a path url from selection dialog box

    

   NSOpenPanel*	lPanel = [NSOpenPanel openPanel];
    [lPanel setAllowsMultipleSelection:YES];
    if ([lPanel runModalForDirectory:@"~" file:nil types:nil]==NSOKButton) {
        int		i;
        for (i=0; i<lPanel filenames] count]; i++) {
            [[NSString*	lPath = lPanel filenames] objectAtIndex:i];
            NSURL*	lUrl = [NSURL  fileURLWithPath:lPath];
            [mPlayList addObject:[lUrl absoluteString;
        }

More OO way:

    

NSOpenPanel* lPanel = [NSOpenPanel openPanel];
[lPanel setAllowsMultipleSelection:YES];
if ([lPanel runModalForDirectory:nil file:nil types:nil]==NSOKButton)
{
   NSEnumerator *fNamesEnumerator = lPanel filenames] objectEnumerator];
   [[NSString *eachPath = nil;

   while (eachPath = [fNamesEnumerator nextObject])
   { 
      NSURL* lUrl = [NSURL  fileURLWithPath:eachPath];
      [mPlayList addObject:[lUrl absoluteString]];
   }
}



*Not only is it more OO, but it's probably also more efficient, because it only has to call     nextObject with each iteration instead of     filenames/    count and     filenames/    objectAtIndex:. The first loop could be improved by storing the array of file names in an ivar. --JediKnil*

I wouldn't exactly call that an 'improvement' ;) Better would be to store both the array and the count in local variables outside the loop's scope.
