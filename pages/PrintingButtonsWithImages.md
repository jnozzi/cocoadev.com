Is there a way to print buttons which have images attached so that they look like they do on the screen? For example, I have some buttons which have 3-D images of arrows including shadows. The image files are tiffs with transparency. They look fine on the screen. But when they are printed they look terrible. They appear to be slightly oversized. They are cropped. And worst of all they have a black background---they are NOT transparent.

I am just letting Cocoa do its default thing by sending "print:" to the window. Should I be doing something else? Or do I have to delete the buttons from the printout?
