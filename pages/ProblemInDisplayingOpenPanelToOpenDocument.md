I am opening file using OpenDocument (Document Based Cocoa Applicaion). Whenever I try to open a document, it takes a lot of time to display the open panel (somewhere around 1 min). What could be the problem?  Is there a way to find out why the open panel is taking so long to display?

If you use an iDisk on a .mac account, that seems to really slow down the open panel a lot.

No, I am not using .mac account on iDisk.
