I have been a Cocoa developer for a very long time ; the farthest thing I can think of was getting the Yellow Box CDs for Windows + Rhapsody back in 1998. What a good day... And I am still at it, more than ever ;-). Please have a look at http://www.creaceed.com for an overview of our stuff for Mac and iPhone.
