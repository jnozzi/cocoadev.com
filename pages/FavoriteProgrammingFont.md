What is your favorite programming font and size?

Monaco 9

Apple's old MPW font is good too, even with antialiasing. I'm using Bitstream's Vera Sans Mono currently, and it's good if you're using AntiAliasing.
Without AntiAliasing, Monaco 9 does rock. See http://keithdevens.com/wiki/ProgrammerFonts for lots of fonts. -- EmanueleVulcano aka l0ne
