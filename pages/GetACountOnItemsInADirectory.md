Is there a faster way to get the count of items in a directory than     [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] directoryContentsAtPath:aPath] count]; ? Because I'm not interested in the items but only in the amount of items in that folder.

----
FSGetCatalogInfo should be much faster at obtaining this information, at least on HFS+ drives.
----
OK, thanks. any hint which Info I need to query? kFSCatInfoFinderInfo? or kFSCatInfoValence - says it's for folders only... or kFSCatinfoFinderXInfo?
----
kFSCatInfoValence is what you want. -W
----
Great, thanks. It also counts invisible files... any way to disable that?
----
Nope. The question of whether a file is invisible or not is quite complex. You will have to walk the directory contents and determine each file's visibility individually.
----
Darn. well that defeats the whole purpose of the "avoiding nsfilemanager" thing. Is there something faster than directoryContentsAtPath?

----
FSGetCatalogInfoBulk. However, the cost needed to determine visibility of each file is likely to outweigh the cost of iterating the directory.

----
NSFileManager is used throughout the system and is basically just a wrapper for the appropriate POSIX and Carbon calls. Are you sure that NSFileManager is the cause of your bottleneck in this case?
----
Apparently not. I just tested it, a count of nsfilemanager's directorycontentsatpath is much faster than FSGetCatalogInfo (talking about milliseconds)... bottleneck sure is somewhere else.

The fastest way to count files on OS X is with fts_open(). This is a BSD function and it allocates memory sparingly. You can specify if you want each file's stat or not with the flag FTS_NOSTAT. Just "man fts_open" for more info. --zootbobbalu
