QuartzComposer is a free application that is bundled with Apple's latest developer tools since Tiger. 

[Topic]

This app lets you build "qtz" files graphically by dragging Quartz filters and other graphic components called "patches" onto a schematic like working surface. Components are connected together by dragging lines between each component's input and output ports. Search ADC with the key words "Quartz" and "Composer" for more info.
