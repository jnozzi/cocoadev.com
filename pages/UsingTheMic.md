How (in programming) can you utilize the microphone built in to most macs? I can't find any API for it. And please, if there is any other way, SPARE me from General/CoreAudio... there must be something else that uses the mic. 3rd party frameworks are great...

I used General/QuickTime's Sequence Grabber (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/General/QuickTime/RM/General/CreatingMovies/General/SeqGrabComp/index.html )

General/CoreAudio isn't as scary as it pretends to be anyway; there are some General/ObjC wrappers for it which can handle some General/AudioUnit-related things, though I'm unaware as to the extent of their device handling.
