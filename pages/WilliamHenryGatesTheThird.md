Bill Gates. Otherwise known as Mr. Big.

Approach with caution, as he has been known to acquire supposed competitors.

A convicted felon (monopoly) who's successfully bought a get-out-of-jail-free card.

Not content with buying Bungie - he has just snapped up Rare - developers of General/GoldenEye and Perfect Dark, so people will buy his huge ugly xBox.   What a Dick.  How I hate him.

His just deserts are coming.  The EU is watching MS like a hawk.  Linux is eating into something more important than Market Share: Mind Share.  Governments around the world are starting to use more Open Source Software for the simple fact that they can **actually** change the code for their use.  Ten years and MS will no longer be a threat, but normal competition.

I'm not sure that calling Bill Gates a "convicted felon" is technically true. Monopoly is the crime of a business, not of an individual, no? Anyone here do law?

While some people may hate him, you have to admit that he's quite a smart business man.
