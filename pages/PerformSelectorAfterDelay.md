I'm trying to use performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: in my .mailbundle, but it hasn't been working correctly.  Using performSelector:withObject:  works just fine, but once I add a delay, such as     [self performSelector:@selector(mySelector) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.5];, the selector does not get called.  I thought that maybe it had to do with the modes that are available through performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:inModes: and the fact that I'm running this in a .mailbundle, but after limited testing, that didn't work either.  Does anyone have any suggestions into getting this to work?  Thanks!

Well, what is the thread doing after issuing that command?  As long as you have a runloop which you are going to return to, this should work.

Is the any NSRunLoop<nowiki/>s running in your thread? Are you trying to run     performSelector::: from a secondary thread?
If you want to delay selector to the next run loop sequence, try to use this:

    
id currentRunLoop = [NSRunLoop currentRunLoop];
id defaultRunLoopModeArray = [NSArray arrayWithObject:NSDefaultRunLoopMode];	
[currentRunLoop performSelector:@selector(mySelector)
	target:self
	argument:nil
	order:0
	modes:defaultRunLoopModeArray];


If you just want a delayed perform, NSTimer is a safer way to do it:

    
[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.5
	target:self
	selector:@selector(myTimerHandler:)
	userInfo:nil
	repeats:NO];

/* */

- (void) myTimerHandler:(NSTime *)aTimer {
   [self mySelector];
}


As you can see, the only difference here is a dedicated method which is needed to handle timer firings.

What, exactly, is supposed to be the difference between using     performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: and the above code snippets? They all accomplish the exact same thing and have the same limitations. -- MikeAsh
