Is it possible to locate the download folder in Cocoa (and/or Carbon) without having to delve in InternetConfig? None of the usual candidates (NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains, FSFindFolder) do this, and InternetConfig makes it a pain by requiring me to use FSSpec -- a type that was marked as deprecated in the PowerPC -> IntelCore transition, thus making me worry about the portability of my code.

The download folder is stored as data in a plist called com.apple.internetconfig.plist.  The data is an alias to the folder.  I realize this involves "devling into internet config", but it works fine for me.

I meant "delving into InternetConfig" as in "having to use the very old, half-deprecated InternetConfig APIs". Which I don't have to, thanks to you :).

Anyway, it's a NSDictionary plist with "Version X.X.X" [NSDictionary] > "ic-added" [NSDictionary] > "DownloadFolder" [NSDictionary] > "ic-data" [NSData], for everyone's future reference, where X.X.X is 2.5.4 in my case (but might reasonably vary) and is the only item in the root NSDictionary.

I'm concerned that the above solution reads the Internet Config plist directly. This seems a little fragile to me. I've written the code to load it from IC using the APIs.
It isn't pretty but it seems safer.

Getting the downloads folder using IC:

    

- (NSString*)downloadsLocationFromIC
{
	NSString	*	result = nil;
	ICInstance		icInstance = {'\0'};
	
	if ( ICStart ( &icInstance, '????' ) == noErr )
	{
		OSStatus	error = noErr;
		ICAttr		attr = {'\0'};
		Handle		downloadFolderDataSpec = NewHandle(0);
		
		// Grab ICFileSpec data...
		error = ICFindPrefHandle ( icInstance, kICDownloadFolder, &attr, downloadFolderDataSpec );
		if ( error == noErr && downloadFolderDataSpec != NULL )
		{
			// How big is alias data?
			long	aliasSize = GetHandleSize(downloadFolderDataSpec) - sizeof(ICFileSpec) + sizeof(AliasRecord);
			
			// Make new handle to hold just the alias data (not the ICFileSpec header).
			AliasHandle	aliasHandle = (AliasHandle)NewHandleClear(aliasSize);
			if ( aliasHandle != NULL )
			{
				ICFileSpec	**	fileSpec = (ICFileSpec**)downloadFolderDataSpec;
				FSRef			ref = {'\0'};
				Boolean			wasChanged = FALSE;

				// Copy aliasrecord data into aliashandle
				HLock( downloadFolderDataSpec );
				HLock( (Handle)aliasHandle );
				memcpy( *aliasHandle, &((**fileSpec).alias), aliasSize);
				
				// Resolve and get path from URL....
				if ( FSResolveAlias( NULL, aliasHandle, &ref, &wasChanged ) == noErr )
				{
					CFURLRef url = CFURLCreateFromFSRef( NULL, &ref );
					if ( url != NULL )
					{
						result = [((NSURL*)url) path];
						CFRelease( url );
					}
				}
				
				DisposeHandle( (Handle)aliasHandle );
			}
			
			DisposeHandle( downloadFolderDataSpec );
		}
		
		ICStop ( icInstance );
	}
	
	return( result );
}



Enjoy!
