The PowerOfPlainText comes from being able to edit it with any text editor (so no need for special tools to deal with a binary format), as well as being able to inspect all of the file, instead of just the subset that a tool decides to show you.

Grr! PlainText to a given power!

Would that have a textponent?

*Beautiful*.
