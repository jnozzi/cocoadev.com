CocoaDevCentral is a sort of a kindred spirit to CocoaDev. Both allow user participation in writing content for the site, and both are devoted to Cocoa.

CocoaDevCentral has many helpful tutorials, and a cool industrial look.

April 2004 (?): after several months of inactivity, the site seems to be back in business under their new management... Yeah!!

-- New articles aren't posted too often, but are pretty nice when they are. The new design is pretty nice. Some users say that the site still needs forums.
