Please add links to wiki pages, books, and websites that are of assistance to programmers using Carbon.

From http://developer.apple.com/carbon/ ...
Carbon is a set of APIs for developing full-featured, high-performance, and reliable applications for Mac OS X. Carbon enables C and C++ developers to take advantage of Mac OS X-specific features, including an advanced user interface toolkit, an efficient event-handling mechanism, the Quartz 2D graphics library, and multiprocessing support. In addition, other industry-standard C and C++ APIs are easily available to Carbon developers, providing access to such services as the OpenGL drawing system, the Mach microkernel, and BSD operating-system services. And you can use virtually any Macintosh development environment that supports PowerPC to build Carbon applications.
