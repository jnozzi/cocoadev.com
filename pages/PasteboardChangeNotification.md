I think this has been discussed before, but what is the recommended way of being notified about pasteboard contents changes?

For example if a Find Panel is showing and somewhere else the user selects "Copy Selection To Find Pasteboard", the panel should immediately update the find-string shown, which it does in many programs -- but how will it know? especially when using 3rd party views which implement     copySelectionToFindPboard: and handles it autonomously.

A simple search for P**'asteboardChange leads somewhere, but then, this should be **your** search not mine...
