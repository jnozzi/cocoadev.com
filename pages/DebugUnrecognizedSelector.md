Is there any convenient way to debug an error with a selector not recognized via breaking, in the debugger, when such an error occurs or, in a more general sense, is there any facility we can use to make an application decipher its call stack with its debugging symbols to print out a stack trace at any arbitrary point in the code?

Didn't totally understand the second bit, but is the info at StackTraces what you're after?  For the first, you should break on -[NSException raise].  See DebuggingTechniques.

Thanks, that looks like exactly what I needed.  At work I have been getting used to the conveniences in Java's Throwable for printing stack traces and I have been craving something similar for my own work.
