Hi,

simple question,

I have a tableView, it has a context menu attached to it. When the user control-clicks on the tableView to bring up the menu I want the row in the tableView that was context-clicked to be selected. This is not the case by default, context clicking rows does not alter the selection of the table.

How can I convince my tableView to behave like that in iTunes for instance, where context-clicking a row selects it.

Thanks for your help!

There's some code that purports to do this at RightClickSelectInTableView
