Hello,

I am trying to mimic the behaviour of the action button with a contextual menu, like the one in the finder that gives you the menu for the second mouse button. OK, so far I create a NSPopUpButton and set the first item to a dummy with a picture. That works quite well, but how to change this icon to another one if the user clicks on it? I tried different things like changing the icon in the action method and so on but nothing works...

Any good ideas out there?
