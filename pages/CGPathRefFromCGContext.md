I realise it's undocumented, but anyone know if there's any way to get the current path from a CGContext? If I can get that, I can convert it to an NSBezierPath, and then it becomes a lot more useful. The reason being that I want to take advantage of     CGContextReplacePathWithStrokedPath(...); in my own code, rather than just leaving it in the context where all I can do with it is fill or stroke it. --GrahamCox

Yes there is a way - and its undocumentedness is documented here: http://archives.devshed.com/forums/bsd-93/how-to-get-the-stroke-geometry-of-a-nsbezierpath-2171896.html --BjoernKriews

Thanks, just the ticket :). Basically it's:

    extern CGPathRef	CGContextCopyPath( CGContextRef context );

A worthwhile piece of UndocumentedGoodness. --GC.
