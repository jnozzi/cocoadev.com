L0Worker is a class that handles working asynchronously while keeping the main thread informed of the progress of the operation (a very common thing to do -- see Finder, General/StuffitExpander, General/DiskUtility...).

To use it, simply subclass it like this:

    

@interface General/SomeWorkerClass : L0Worker { }
@end

@implementation General/SomeWorkerClass

 - (General/NSError*) work {
    /* do some work here, use [self setProgress:...] to send progress messages to the delegate,
    return nil on success or a General/NSError* on failure. */
 }

@end

/* ... somewhere else, in your GUI code ... */

General/SomeWorkerClass* worker = General/[SomeWorkerClass new];
[worker setDelegate:self];
[worker detachWorkerThread];

/* ... let it do its work or call [worker cancel] to stop it ... */

- (void) worker:(L0Worker*) worker didEndWithFinalStatus:(General/NSError*) err canceled:(BOOL) canceled {
    /* called on the main thread, clean up or present the error if err != nil */
}

    A L0Worker instance (or simply a worker) is an object that encapsulates

    operation synchronously or asynchronously. A delegate object may be
    provided to receive messages as the operation progresses or concludes itself.

    to cancel the operation and -setProgress: to communicate a new operation progress
    value to the delegate.

    the progress value is unknown or cannot be computed), or a float value between 0.0f and 1.0f.
    The default progress value after initialization is kL0WorkerIndefiniteProgress.

    The value is only meaningful while the worker is performing the operation (that is, while
    the -isRunning method returns YES).

    * is actually executing the operation; or
    * is executing cleanup code after the operation, including the delegate message
        -worker:didEndWorkingWithFinalStatus:canceled:.
