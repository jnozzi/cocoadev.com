He is involved in developing the Quantum Chemistry software ADF [http://www.scm.com], which is run the world over on computers ranging from desktop Macs to massive supercomputers. He programs regularly in Python, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, and Bash, and in his spare time develops the Cocoa financial software Trade Strategist [http://www.trade-strategist.com].

----**Comments**----

*Since no one else has left a comment regarding this book I just wanted to say that I'm about halfway through it right now and it has helped me tremendously. It eases even an utter newbie through all the important and basic concepts in OOP programming, C language syntax, Obj C syntax, fundamental concepts like memory management, etc., basically holding your hand while it takes you from knowing next to nothing about Cocoa, to writing a full fledged app that uses both the Cocoa and Carbon frameworks. It also covers various scripting languages as well. I'm finding this book extremely useful, I recommend it to anyone who's just getting started!
*I can recommend this too.  I'm not sure the Carbon focus of some of it is all that relevant, and there is a lot of "useless noise", but it covers C, Objective-C, Cocoa adequately enough to get you over the initial learning curve.  It's also quite cheap, being Wrox.

Thanks for your kind words. My understanding from the publisher is the book did pretty well over its 2-year lifespan. I'm glad that it helped someone out, that was my main goal. -- MikeTrent
