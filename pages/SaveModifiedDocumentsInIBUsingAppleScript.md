Sorry for going a little off-topic, but I need an AppleScript to save all modified documents in Interface Builder (i.e. like Xcode does before you do a build), but I can't figure out how.

It seems IB doesn't respond to     documents and the     window object has no     document property. Strangely it does have a     document edited property (so I can get to whether IB has modified documents, just not save them).

I'd be grateful for any help on the subject!
