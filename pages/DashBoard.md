The Dashboard zooms on top of your Desktop with a click of a function key and, like Exposï¿½, disappears just as quickly and easily. Use the Dashboard to access nifty new mini-applications called Widgets.

Dashboard widgets are written in DHTML & JavaScript. http://developer.apple.com/macosx/dashboard.html

Anyone know if widget preferences (    preferenceForKey()) are compatible with NSUserDefaults?
*They appear to be stored that way, though I am not sure.* -- l0ne aka EmanueleVulcano

Yes, the widget preferences are stored in a domain with "widget-" prepended to the bundle identifier, i.e. "widget-com.apple.widget.stocks".
