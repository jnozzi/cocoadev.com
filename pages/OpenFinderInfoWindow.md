Hi,
I'm having a trouble. I'd want to call the Finder's info window from my cocoa application, but i can't figure out how to do.
I've googled and searched in the Apple documentation, but nothing came out.
The code can be cocoa or carbon as well.
Any suggestions?

Thanks,
LucaC.

There's a sample project, OpenFinderInfoWindow, in the ObjCAppscript repository that does this:

This is not the way i intended, but it works great.  Thanks --LucaC.
