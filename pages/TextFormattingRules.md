Your text will appear exactly as you enter it.  HTML tags are not processed. To include double-percents, precede each one with double-backslash, like so: \\\\%\\\\%

Any fully-qualified General/URLs you enter into the text will automatically become links.  If the URL is that of a GIF or JPEG image file, that image will be inserted into the page, rather than a link. (*Note the URL parser doesn't understand fragment identifiers (#).*)

General/WordsJammedTogether will become links to new or existing pages on this site.

Some custom formatting keywords are available.  To use them, just enter them into your text:



* **\\%\\%BEGINLIST\\%\\%** will open a bulleted list
* **\\%\\%ITEM\\%\\%** adds an item to an opened bulleted list
* **\\%\\%ENDLIST\\%\\%** will end a bulleted list


* **\\%\\%BEGINBOLD\\%\\%** begins a bold section of text
* **\\%\\%ENDBOLD\\%\\%** ends a bold section of text
* Paired triple apostrophes (**    '    '    '...'    '    '    **) can also bold a section of text on a single line


* **\\%\\%BEGINITALIC\\%\\%** begins an italicized section of text
* **\\%\\%ENDITALIC\\%\\%** ends a italicized section of text
* Paired double apostrophes (**    '    '...'    '    **) can also italicize a section of text on a single line


* **\\%\\%BEGINCODE\\%\\%** begins a code block (displayed inside its own inline frame with scrollbars)
* **\\%\\%ENDCODE\\%\\%** ends a code block (displayed inside its own inline frame with scrollbars)


Note that undefined General/WordsJammedTogether are not marked with a ? in code blocks.


* **\\%\\%BEGINCODESTYLE\\%\\%** begins monospaced text
* **\\%\\%ENDCODESTYLE\\%\\%** ends monospaced text
* Paired triple-brackets (**{<nowiki/>{{...}}<nowiki/>}**) can also create a monospace section of text on a single line





* **\\%\\%LINE\\%\\%** adds a horizontal line to the text.
* **\\%\\%REPLY\\%\\%** starts a new post in a conversation, ended by the next \\%\\%REPLY\\%\\% or \\%\\%LINE\\%\\% (Please discuss this new feature on General/SignArguments)



You can prevent General/WordsJammedTogether from being made into Wiki links by using six single quotes after the first letter of a word: **E'    '    '    '    '    'scapeWordsJammedTogether** becomes E<nowiki/>scapeWordsJammedTogether

----(Actually, it needs to be after the initial capital letters; e.g., NST'    '    '    '    '    'ableView, instead of N'    '    '    '    '    'General/STableView)----

However, the use of General/WordsJammedTogether is one of the fundamental principles of the General/WikiWikiWeb, so unless you have a good reason (like you're illustrating how General/WordsJammedTogether work), you shouldn't try to escape them. The main use for this is so that plurals are properly General/WikiLink<nowiki/>ed. For example, we do not need separate entries for General/NSTableView and NST<nowiki/>ableViews, so stick the six apostrophes before the last letter and it's excluded from the word (e.g. NST<nowiki/>ableView'    '    '    '    '    's becomes General/NSTableView<nowiki/>s). You can even use this trick to talk about General/NSTableView<nowiki/>'s General/SuperClass and it'll get the *    's* right.
