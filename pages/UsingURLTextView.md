Was wanting to use General/URLTextView , but found the apple example very complicated, it it required 10.2 (and usunually used carbon headers!?), so i decided not to use it. All i require is a simple example of how to make a piece of text in my program a link, and for the hand to come up when i hover over the link.

got this far...

General/[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] openURL:[NSURL General/URLWithString:@"https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=wispsw%40hotmail.com&item_name=Renamer&item_number=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD"]];

but i still need to text underline color change and hand =)

thanks
