I am working on a project  which needs to open two document files: Doc1 and Doc2.  Then I need to show each of them in two separete windows, compare and analysis those two documents and display the result in another window.

I'm planning to start with document-based applications, open both files in different windows, load in datas, then do the manipulations. My  first of all question is: how could I pass datas of Doc1 and Doc2 accross the whole application ?

Is there any similar example I could look into?

Thanks in advance
