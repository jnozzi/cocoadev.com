Yowza.

I'm 16, Alaska/USA student, just started learning Cocoa. Which basically means I have to re-learn everything about programming, given that my previous work was in TI-BASIC. Not the best language ever.

I wrote a couple of... um... "bad" programs in TI-BASIC, then a couple good ones, then dropped it. Moved on to Inform, decided it didn't do enough. (Well, it IS designed for interactive fiction.) Started learning C++, realized it wasn't going to help much if I couldn't make an actual app on the Mac, and the tutorials didn't seem to be going that way anytime soon. Then I picked up Aaron Hillegass' book. And the rest is history.

Well, technically, that's ALL history, since it's all gone past. Not to ruin the colloquialism or anything.

So yeah, I know TI-BASIC, HTML, PHP (with MySQL), Inform, a smattering of C++, and now I'm learning Cocoa.

I'm an Eagle Scout.
I play violin.
I would recommend a nice book called Macintosh... The Naked Truth by Scott Kelby to any serious Mac fan. :) Of which I am one.
I also recommend T<nowiki/>houShaltNot (http://thoushalt.net). They use Macs and their music is awesome.
I've used Macs since the age of 2 and was utterly confounded when first confronted with a PC, quickly developing an aversion to it.
