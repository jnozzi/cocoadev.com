I would like to make an NSTableView with "fat" cells. Something a bit like the feeds view in NewsFire. I don't need the NSOutlineView behavior they use there, but I'd like my cells to be taller than usual, so as to allow a line of text below the main text. I know I'll probably have to subclass the NSCell that goes into the NSTableView but I'm not quite sure how to actually do that.

Thank you!

Whoops! I just saw it's as simple as changing the rowheight in IB :) And to add the line of text underneath, it should be as simple as using an NSAttributedString as the cell value, right?

Whee!

Make sure the table cell is an NSTextFieldCell. I couldn't get multi-line cells to work without it. Oh, and just use a newline tag (type "\n" - without the quotes) to do a line break...

Also might want to look into just custom drawing the cell instead of the attributed string -- it's easier in some cases with per pixel tweakage, etc.
