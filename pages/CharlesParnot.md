Charles Parnot

Biologist, always looking for a good excuse to write some Cocoa code to analyze data.

I contributed to:

*
PerlObjCBridge (with some code in AddSystemFramework)
*
XCodeAndNibFilesWithCVS
*
SavingFilePackageWithManySmallIndependentFiles
*
XGridDummyPlugin
*
HowToGetHardwareAndNetworkInfo


These are links of things I like or want to remember, so I like to have shortcuts to them:

*AspectCocoa
*FastTextRenderingInNSView
*AltivecOptimization
