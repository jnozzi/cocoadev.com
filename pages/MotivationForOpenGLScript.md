OpenGLScript is going to be a basic scripting language for the beginner OpenGL programmer. This language will allow you to play with OpenGL calls without having to recompile every time you want to see the effects of changing a single parameter. 

I'm going to provide an object that can interpret OpenGLScript and output the interpretation to source. This source code will be compatible with Cocoa's implementation of OpenGL. The interpreter will also be able to load an OpenGLScript dynamically so you can modify scripts and view the effects of the modifications on the fly (while the OpenGL context is open). --zootbobbalu

Hey, this is cool. It'd be great combined with a little prototyping environment so you could play around in a single running app.
