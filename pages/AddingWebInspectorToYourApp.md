Hey, guys. I'm working on an application that is heavily based on web view, and having people create plugins for the app using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). For those developers, I want to be able to have the standard Web Inspector from Safari or WebKit to be tied in for them to debug their code. I'm not quite sure how to do this. In downloading other people's source code, I came across Appcelerator's Titanium, which, from my understanding, has the Web Inspector built in. I've tried looking at their code and adapting it to fit my application, but it doesn't seem to be working... I'll give it another go in case I missed something, but if I didn't, how else would I go about implementing it?
