I'm starting to test some new code on an x86 box running FreeBSD and GNUstep. I'm also working on an Xcode setup to edit the code on my G5 and build the x86 code remotely using RPC calls. It's going to be a simple setup, but before I get really deep into it I was wondering if anyone else here is doing the same thing? --zootbobbalu
