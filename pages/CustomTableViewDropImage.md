Hi

Normally when you drag something over a TableView row, it outlines the row in black.  How can i customize what is drawn?  I have looked through all of the TableView methods and have found nothing for this (and no way to determine if the row is the one the drag is hovering over, otherwise I would just use the row drawing method).  Thanks for any help
