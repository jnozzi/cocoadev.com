I'm trying to incorporate into my audio app the feature to use and display iTunes Visual plug-ins:
I do have audio/freq/levs information, and I want to pass it to this "object" and I want to use it a Custom NSView...

Any ideas?

The nearest thing I've seen it's 2002's Micono iTunes Visualizar plug-in for RealBasic, but the guy won't answer any mails... (even though I do speak Japanese)
