Hello everyone,

In relation to the same project as FindingSubnet, I am looking for help embedding a control (specifically a small clickable icon (much like the magnifying glass in the search field)), inside of an NSTextField. This will be used to allow a user to click on an item and have it zip them to the right spot in the program, or entry in the XML file (as it were), without a lot of effort.  It would also allow for the content to remain editable, and prevent the interface from becoming too crowded.


Thanks for the help.


Regards,

This example reimplements an NSSearchField from a NSTextField (and cell etc). Does more than you want but I think you can use it to figure out how to do what you want:

CCDTextField does this and was written because NMSearchField did a little more than I wanted. :-)

Usage is pretty easy too, assuming you've changed the class of     textfield in IB...
    
- (void)awakeFromNib
{
id leftCell = textfield cell] leftButtonCell]; // or rightButtonCell

     [leftCell setImage:[[[NSImage imageNamed:@"yourImage.tiff"]];
     [leftCell setTarget:self];
     [leftCell setAction:@selector(leftCellAction:)];
}

Does this also work with a subclass of NSSecureTextField. I tried this with other examples, but the icon never appeared :(
