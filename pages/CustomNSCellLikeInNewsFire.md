I'm trying to figure out how they created the cell in the tableview on the left hand side in news fire.  It has a title in black, a sub title below it in light grey and a badge on the right with the number of unread articles for that feed.  Any help would be much appreciated.

For the shading, see ITunesStyleGradient.

For the badge, you'll want to either create your own custom cell that draws the badge how you want it, or create a new column (setting an NSImageCell as its prototype cell),   render an image using a pre-made badge background and draw a number in it, then set that as the image used in the image column.
