Just want to know how to get the memory footprint of an object.

The code below prints "size of a NSObject: 4"
    
NSLog (@"size of a NSObject: %i", sizeof (NSObject));


Even according to Foundation/NSObject.h it is 4 bytes:

    
@interface NSObject
{
	Class isa;
}
...


but I know it can't be (i.e. what about the retain count and other stuff which is private???)

Is there any way to determine exactly the footprint of any object? Thx

Because all you are really checking with the function sizeof is the size of the pointer to the object.  So 4 bytes is correct for that.  The size of the object itself has its size checked using a different method.  -- DavidKopec

NSObject is not a pointer, it is the object itself. id is a pointer. -- KritTer

KritTer is right. If you want a proof:

    

@interface MyObject : NSObject
{
	id anID;
}
@end

void showMe ()
{
	NSLog (@"size of MyObject: %i", sizeof (MyObject));
}



gives "size of MyObject: 8"

Back to the question: I haven't found find any class methods or whatever giving the size of an object... Any help?

Alas, even the objc runtime agrees with sizeof. The following:

    
    NSLog(@"NSObject size: %d",
          ((struct objc_class *)[NSObject class])->instance_size);
    NSLog(@"NSObject ivars: %d",
          ((struct objc_class *)[NSObject class])->ivars->ivar_count);


gives "NSObject size: 4" and "NSObject ivars: 1". ("ivars" = instance variables")

I assume the retain count is kept elsewhere, perhaps by the NSAutoreleasePool class.

So it seems like I can trust sizeof...

I don't know for sure how it's implemented by Apple, but I can tell you how it's implemented in GNUstep. Here is a small part of the NSObject code :

    
/*    Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 *    This file is part of the GNUstep Base Library.
 *    Released under the GPL v2
 */
- (id)retain
{
  NSIncrementExtraRefCount(self);
  return self;
}

void
NSIncrementExtraRefCount(id anObject)
{
  if (allocationLock != 0)
    {
      objc_mutex_lock(allocationLock);
      ((obj)anObject)[-1].retained++;
      objc_mutex_unlock (allocationLock);
    }
  else
    {
      ((obj)anObject)[-1].retained++;
    }
}


So the retain count is kept 4 bytes *before* the actual position of the 
pointer. Why is it done like this ?

Partly to support garbage collecting. It lets you add garbage collecting without changing the interface of any class, you would just need to change the alloc/retain/release/dealloc methods of NSObject.

GNUstep does support garbage collecting for the base library (the equivalent of
the FoundationKit), but I never tried 'cause it doesn't work for the gui part.
