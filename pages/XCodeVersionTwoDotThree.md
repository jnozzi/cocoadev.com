Has anyone noticed that when you copy code from Xcode, it stays formatted with colors and such? I think this is new to Xcode 2.3... either way, it's very nice for emailing code and such. Now only if it was ouputted with HTML.. :)

Just paste it in General/TextEdit and save it as HTML if you need it. -- General/EmanueleVulcano aka l0ne
