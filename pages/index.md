The New CocoaDev
================

**EDITING HAS BEEN DISABLED HERE**

The CocoaDev site is undergoing some big changes to take it into 2014 and beyond. See below for details.

You can currently contribute edits via a fork and pull request on [github](https://github.com/jnozzi/cocoadev.com).

The Skinny
----------

* Converted to full Markdown syntax
* Migrated to a Github repository (clone, modify, pull request)
* Accepted pull requests use Markdoc to convert to static content, push to server

Benefits
--------

* Eliminates wiki-spam
* Manages edit conflicts
* Speeds up live site
* Allows mass edits (yay!)
* Standardizes markup

Timeline
--------

EDITABLE SOON. Check this page for updates.
