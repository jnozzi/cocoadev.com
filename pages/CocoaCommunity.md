Speaking as a co-founder of CocoaHeads, if you can't find an established group the thing is to start one.  CocoaHeads got started by emailing some programmer folks I knew would probably be interested, emailing an announcement to the leaders of the local Mac Users Groups to forward to their membership, and making a posting to the Cocoa lists. (Just one or two should be enough.  I sometimes put a cocoaheads pointer into my signature when I answer questions on the lists, to help spread the word but not be obnoxious about it).  We've managed to attract a core group of folks, and generally have a couple of new folks show up at meetings.

Howdy guys. I produce CocoaRadio and have recently started promoting CocoaDevHouse, a mission in the spirit of the Bay Area's SuperHappyDevHouse.org and BarCamp, to self-organize periodic hackathons for Cocoa and Apple enthusiasts. 

This is not a replacement for user groups but a way to mobilize people with a variety of skills and interests, including UX designers, Cocoa devs, Web service (PHP/Rails) devs, and other creative types. We've got that sort of mix convening in Dallas for the first event which will be streamed: Chime in remotely via irc://irc.freenode.net/#CocoaDevHouse 

I emphasize: this is a grassroots effort; open to all interested folks anywhere ?la BarCamp.org

Flickr group: 

...and, of course, T-shirts are available if you've got room next to your Panic wardrobe ;) 

Thanks. Blake  AIM/GTalk: cocoaradio

The problem I see is that your site is "everywhere". You've got flickr groups, google groups, regional subdivisions, etc. but you appear to have no content other than placeholders for sub-groups. To be successful, I recommend putting up some actual content that would interest Cocoa developers otherwise you'll never draw enough people to create a community.

That said, I wish you the best of luck - the Cocoa community could do with an updated, centralized place for 'everything'. I hope you succeed.
