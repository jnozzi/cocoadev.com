Is there any rule on which colours to use for non-focused controls?

E.g. if I draw selected text (normally using General/NSColor's selectedTextBackgroundColor for a focused view) then which colour should I use when my view no longer have focus/is key?

On a related note, is there any colour defined for the insertion point? and also a width (seems to be one pixel, except in General/WorldText)?

Selected text in a view without focus should be light grey and the insertion point is always black!
