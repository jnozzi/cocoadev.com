HighCohesion is a GRASP*-pattern** which says that a method should do a precise single task. This is to maximise readability, extensibility and reusability. One rule is that if you can't easily name a method, it's not cohesive and should be rewritten.

* GRASP stands for General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns. More info here: http://www.onr.com/user/loeffler/java/grasp.html. The GRASP-patterns** are more fundamental than the GangOfFour-patterns, they deal with design rather than with implementation.

** I don't know how to mention this without the redundant acronym
