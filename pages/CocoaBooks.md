Here's a list of published (or soon to be) books on Cocoa Programming.  If you have an opinion, please VOTE* on each book!  Books appear in ALPHABETICAL order.  If you know of any other books please add them this list.  If you know of any additional links on where to purchase the books feel free to add those as well.  Don't pay too much attention to the List Price as online book retaillers will often sell the book for much less than this.  You might even get lucky and be able to snag a copy for cheap off of eBay if you put a little effort into searching for it. --> K.

*About the voting section:

Votes must be entered on the individual book's page. The categories are: 

***BUY IT** - You need this book in your library.  Pronto! *apologies to whoever wrote "Prompto" if they intended that.*
***BORROW IT** - Some useful material, but overall it may not be worth your hard earned cash.  But look for it on eBay any how.
***BURY IT** - BURN it, BLISTER it, BREACH it; --Just don't BOTHER with it 'cause it BITES!

*Once Again...  About the List Prices:


*This is the book's suggested retail price.  But take this with a grain of salt for you will often find that the book is sold up to 20% to 30% less on Amazon or Barnes and Noble and you might even search Ebay for used copies at a fraction of the list price.
