Can I do the following:

    
- (void)someMethod
{
     id pointer = self;
     self = [[SomeClass alloc] init];
     [pointer release];
}


**Why do you want to release yourself?**

Scratch this conversation.  It is continued in MakingAnInstanceSwitchClass

*Just for the record, the answer is no. This code will not work because the new     self will not magically be transmitted outside the method. The caller will suddenly hold an invalid object, and the new one will leak.*

Sadly, I realized immediately after posting... and made the appropriate comment inside MakingAnInstanceSwitchClass :(
