Slightly OT.

I have been passing code between people using iChat and of course it is smart enough to recognise code fragments like this :[ or :( as unhappy faces. 

I am wondering, is there anyway we can create other emoticons by passing around code fragments, other than these glum sad faces?

(Just something fun for everyone to think about). ;)

Interesting fragments. I doubt I would copy comments though. :)

You can get :) easily too - @selector(moof:)

*How could you get *that* into working code?!?*

I'm pretty sure it's valid Perl. ;-)

I don't know how you'd get that into working code, but how about:

B^(l)

or 

B^(I)

|=

C|=D (this one goes both ways, allowing for hats.)
