I need some help with writing a resume geared toward a position for a cocoa devoper. Any generic examples would be greatly appreciated. Also, hints and suggestions on the Do's and Don'ts for this type of resume would be helpful.

One of the sticking points that I have is how I should convey that I have been a serious Cocoa developer for five years now, but this experience is not remotely related to my "real" job.
