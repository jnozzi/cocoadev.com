NSStatusBar coordinates the placement of NSStatusItems, hiding ones that would be covered up by menus when the menubar changes (ie, by switching applications). Therefore, there must be some way to programmatically determine the amount of free space in the menubar. Does anybody know what it might be? I'm trying to create a status item that resizes itself dynamically.
