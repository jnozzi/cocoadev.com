In my last and first Cocoa project, DirectionService, I have made some useful addition to various Cocoa classes, and some utilities like NIRTimer. I just started a new project, and I want most of them in the new project. I guess I should build a library or framework, but I never done this before.

I would like to hear how are you reusing and managing your code. --NirSoffer
