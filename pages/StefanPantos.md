Currently I am a General/DPhil student at the University of Oxford working in the Chemical Crystallography Lab. I moved here after completing a General/BSc at Durham University in Artificial Intelligence.

My General/DPhil work is on Least Squares refinement of Small Molecule single crystal structures. I am also working on a General/MacOS X version of the software Crystals < http://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/crystals.html > . Sadly this is done using wxCarbon not wxCocoa which would be preferable.

I have a small program called General/NoteBook < http://www.beaversoft.co.uk/General/NoteBook/index.html > which I am currently trying to rewrite but not getting very far.

I have been programming for the past 7 years. My first language was Pascal and Delphi

I have working have summer internships at:
*http://www.dip.co.uk/ - Developing DEVILS
*http://www.dl.ac.uk/ - Data calibration software for Powder refraction data and control software. On two separate occasions 

I have been taught:
*Pascal
*Java
*Perl
*Haskell

I have taught my self:
*BASIC
*Visual Basic
*C
*C++
*Objective-C
*80286 asm (Not very much but a little)
