    
 Boolean CFURLGetFSRef (
    CFURLRef url,
    FSRef *fsRef
 );


Retrieves the FSRef associated with a given CFURLRef; returns false on failure, true on success.

I presume the CFURL must be a file:// URL, or this function won't do any good. *The documentation does seem to imply that*.

NSURL object pointers are TollFreeBridged with the CFURLRef type -- you can cast them freely between both types and use them happily and nicely with either Cocoa or CoreFoundation api calls. See NSURL for more information on the NSURL type.
