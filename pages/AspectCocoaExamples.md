**Exploring NSTextView**

Suppose we have an NSTextView and we want it to update some other control every time someone clicks into it.  Well, we could look at http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/ObjC_classic/Classes/NSTextView.html  But, what if we could just write a couple of lines of code that meant that whenever any method gets called on NSTextView or its superclasses, we NSLog some information about that method call.  Now we can run an application, click in the box and see which methods got called.  So now we can subclass NSTextView and we know just what method to override.
