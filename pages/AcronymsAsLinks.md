I have a few TLA's (ThreeLetterAcronyms) which I would like to add descriptions for. Is it possible to add pages to this wiki where all characters are uppercase, like STL, POD and similar?

**No. The plurals, however... just leave out the apostrophe.**

----

Why not just use PODPlainOldData and STLStandardTemplateLibrary?

**That would work too.**

But then, why bother with the TLA in the first place? Also, I would then only do it if I really thought that people would not know the meaning, e.g. I wouldn't start to write GUIGraphicalUserInterface and PixelPictureElement etc., even though definitions of these things would certainly be nice...
