This space available to write a CoreAudio tutorial or add insights. Some areas in which the original poster was interested:

- Reading an audio file (actually using QTSoundFilePlayer)

- Directing this audio to other AudioUnit (QTSoundFilePlayer, but generating audio outputs, not directed to another kind of AudioUnit)

- Move the file reader to a particular time position in the file (QTSoundFilePlayer can do this, but what if I don't use it)

- Drawing an image of the waveform (not really an audio project, but an NSView project)
