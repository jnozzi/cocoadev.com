Hi,
I checked the API docs and all the 'tutorials' and sample I could find about Bluetooth.
Sadly, the Bluetooth API is not docummented to well... I can only do basic File Transfers (via Push) hehe

I hope someone here can help me - or at least give me clues as to how to do it :D

I'm not 100% sure of this, but I think that the bluetooth stack in Mac OS X doesn't support stuff like that. At least that's what some little voice in the back of my head tells me..

Well when you have paired your phone Address Book can send SMS messages but I have no idea about how to do it from cocoa.
