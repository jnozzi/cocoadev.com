CocoaWrappers are wrappers around other APIs (typically C or C++), insulating you from having to deal with ugly Carbon types and whatnot. These do away with those horrible procedural API calls and just let you handle objects, as if Apple itself was filling in the holes in the Cocoa API. At least, that's the theory.
