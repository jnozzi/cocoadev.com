The IPTracker Problem.

StevenFrank says it might stop WikiRape, but how. There should be a way to search the IP Address so we could find out what other pages the "abuser" has created/edited.

Do we really want an internal police force? I think things have settled down around here.

Police force, or No Police force, I want people to stop editing my User Page with negative comments.
