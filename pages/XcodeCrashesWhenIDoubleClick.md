Whenever I double click _anything_ in Xcode v1.5 (e.g. source files under the groups and files, search results in a global find, build errors, even NIB files), Xcode crashes.  Any ideas on what to do to fix this problem???

I've noticed this problem first after installing the latest Quicktime 6.5.2 update.

Thanks,
Joe

Trash your  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.xcode.plist file and see if that helps.

----

Trashing the prefs did not help.  I am going to try to download and reinstall Xcode, I think...

----

Probably best. I've installed the QT update and can double-click to my heart's content.

I've re-"upgraded" the devtools, and it hasn't fixed my problem.  Will it cause any damage to uninstall dev-tools (using the included script) and then reinstall them?

Maybe someone has any ideas from this crash log:

This is absolutely what to do. If you're going to try fixing something by reinstalling it, it's always best to remove it and do a *full* reinstallation, not an upgrade.


----

**Have you tried repairing permissions?**

Or doing and archive and install? Sounds more like General/AppKit has been corrupted.

----

I was able to fix the problem by re-installing the Mac OS X Combined Updater.  Thankfully it worked, because I am about 3,000 miles from my OS X 10.3 CD...

Thanks for all of the suggestions.
