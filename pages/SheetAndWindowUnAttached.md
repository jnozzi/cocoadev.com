I have a document based application.  When it runs, a main menu window comes up with a few options for the user (New, Load, Quit, etc.)  I want the user to define a few properties everytime a new document is created (whether it is done from the File Menu or the actually window).  So what I have is a sheet that is displayed from an NSPanel from the MyDocument nib file.  I display this sheet in the:

- (void)windowControllerDidLoadNib:(NSWindowController *) aController

method of MyDocument.h using:

[NSApp beginSheet:newStudioPanel modalForWindow:mainWindow
modalDelegate:self
didEndSelector:NULL
contextInfo:nil];

newStudioPanel being the NSPanel and the mainWindow being the NSWindow of the Document.

When I create a new Document, the document window (mainWindow) appears, and the sheet comes up but not as a sheet for the window.  It isn't attached, but behind the document window.

I have this problem, too
