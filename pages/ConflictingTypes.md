hello, i am  looking for a solution to a little problem i am having. i am trying to build a cocoa app that uses an library that conflicts with the cocoa framework. when i try to build the app i get an error about "conflicting types" and another "previous declaration." i understand what is going on and why. everything that i have tried so far has failed. if you have a solution i would love to hear it. thank you.
