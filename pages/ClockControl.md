Does anybody Know how to make a clock change the seconds,Hours,and minutes using custom number?
As instead of 12 hour clock It dispalys a different number for each second,minute and hour?

You can of course display anything you want. What exactly is your problem? Getting the time? Calculating a value to display? Drawing the clock?

Let pretend that I want to display a clock the just shows numbers and I want to make the clock work so It displays the time.
Lets say i want it to dispaly 1 as 11 and 2 as 22 and 3 as 33  etc. instead of the traditional digital clock 12 clock?.

Get the time, convert it to a string, loop through the string and duplicate any digit.

Just display a clock the just shows numbers. Easy.
