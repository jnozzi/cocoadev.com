Discussions that have been retired. See RetiredVsActiveDiscussions.  To retire a discussion, change its ENTRY to RetiredDiscussions instead of CocoaDiscussions.

When retiring a discussion, do consider whether it needs to remain a discussion or if you can file it in a more useful place on CocoaDev (perhaps after refactoring to winnow the useful information from the chaff). Discussions are tedious to extract information from, and this page is a bit of a backwater.
