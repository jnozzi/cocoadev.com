I am trying to do something rather odd. In my application i am trying to listen for incoming phone calls as to run a method. I honestly have no idea where to begin on this there isn't really much documentation on modem anything on apples developer site, i would imagine it requires use of the BSD sockets. Does anybody have any idea where to begin on this?

It has nothing to do with BSD sockets, which are used to communicate over the internet. You want to talk to a serial device, check out AMSerial.

Serial port communication, modem commands, AT Commands are the key to go..

Thank you that works perfectly
