# CocoaDev site

This site is in the process of being migrated to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Should you want to hack on it (i.e. help migrate from simple md to static pages) be sure to setup jekyll on your machine by following the [installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Much appreciation will be given for:

- adding titles to pages;
- removing outdated content;
- adding auto-linking functionality;
