''By reading the docs.''

What docs? Sorry i thought i put this on the discussions.

Look at the API documentation for [[NSWindow]] at http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/[[ApplicationKit]]/ObjC_classic/Classes/[[NSWindow]].html and note the method "setBackgroundColor:".  The API documentation is the best source for figuring out how to do stuff in Cocoa.
