Just a question regarding adding new content:

I sometimes post info here that I got from the General/MacOsxDev list - I list the original authors' name(s) but usually don't ask for permission before adding this to General/CocoaDev. 

Is that okay or should I always get permission, even if the sample code or tips are made public through the mailing list?

That's an interesting question...  I've done the same thing too.  My feeling is that if you post it to a mailing list, then it has been "published", and that the author intended for other people to see and use the information.  Consider that the message will also be archived in the list archives, and re-published for anyone to see via the web interface...  

That's more of a philosophical perspective than a legal one, though...
