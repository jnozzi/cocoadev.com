General/ProjectBuilder was Apple's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that shipped on the Developer Tools disk with Mac OS X pre-10.3. As of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther General/ProjectBuilder has been replaced with General/XCode, but is still available for download from the ADC software download page. General/ProjectBuilder is unsupported past 10.2 (but has been reported to run) just as General/XCode is unsupported on pre-10.3 systems.

It has all you need to write your application's code, with the interface being taken care of by General/InterfaceBuilder. Other things can be made with image, video, and audio editors.
