Hi,
I'm having a trouble. I'd want to call the Finder's info window from my cocoa application, but i can't figure out how to do.
I've googled and searched in the Apple documentation, but nothing came out.
The code can be cocoa or carbon as well.
Any suggestions?

Thanks,
General/LucaC.

There's a sample project, General/OpenFinderInfoWindow, in the General/ObjCAppscript repository that does this:

http://appscript.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/appscript/objc-appscript/trunk/sample/General/OpenFinderInfoWindow/

This is not the way i intended, but it works great.  Thanks --General/LucaC.
