Name of the old Communities.com Palace server software, now defunct and no longer supported, and was bought by General/OpenText I believe.

Palace is maintained at http://www.thepalace.com , but the software is no longer updated, 3rd party projects have been underway to emulate Palace and eventually produce a new one, including some already attempts at doing new palace protocols and software.

My General/PServer project is a project in General/REALBasic, since I've been lost with networking in other languages like General/ObjC/Cocoa, currently attempting to emulate a Palace Server.

General/PServer is also a term in the CVS world, being one of the server technologies.  pserver is generally only of use when providing for anonymous CVS, since there is no encryption and passwords are sent in the clear.
